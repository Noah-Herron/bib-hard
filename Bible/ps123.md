# Psalm 123
###### ¶ 1
> I look up toward you,
> The one enthroned in heaven.
###### 2
> Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
> As the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress,
> So our eyes will look to the LORD, our God, until he shows us favor.
###### ¶ 3
> Show us favor, O LORD, show us favor!
> For we have had our fill of humiliation, and then some.
###### 4
> We have had our fill
> Of the taunts of the self-assured,
> Of the contempt of the proud.
