# Hosea 12
###### ¶ 1
> Ephraim continually feeds on the wind;
> He chases the east wind all day;
> He multiplies lies and violence.
> They make treaties with Assyria,
> And send olive oil as tribute to Egypt.
###### 2
> The LORD also has a covenant lawsuit against Judah;
> He will punish Jacob according to his ways
> And repay him according to his deeds.
## Israel Must Return to the God of Jacob
###### 3
> In the womb he attacked his brother;
> In his manly vigor he struggled with God.
###### 4
> He struggled with an angel and prevailed;
> He wept and begged for his favor.
> He found God at Bethel,
> And there he spoke with him!
###### 5
> As for the LORD God Almighty,
> The LORD is the name by which he is remembered!
###### 6
> But you must return to your God,
> By maintaining love and justice
> And by waiting for your God to return to you.
## The Lord Refutes Israel’s False Claim of Innocence
###### 7
> The businessmen love to cheat;
> They use dishonest scales.
###### 8
> Ephraim boasts, “I am very rich!
>  “ I have become wealthy!
>  “ In all that I have done to gain my wealth,
>  “ No one can accuse me of any offense that is actually sinful.”
###### 9
>  “ I am the LORD your God who brought you out of Egypt;
>  “ I will make you live in tents again as in the days of old.
###### 10
>  “ I spoke to the prophets;
>  “ I myself revealed many visions;
>  “ I spoke in parables through the prophets.”
###### 11
> Is there idolatry in Gilead?
> Certainly its inhabitants will come to nothing!
> Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal?
> Surely their altars will be like stones heaped up on a plowed field!
## Jacob in Aram, Israel in Egypt, and Ephraim in Trouble
###### ¶ 12
> Jacob fled to the country of Aram,
> Then Israel worked to acquire a wife;
> He tended sheep to pay for her.
###### 13
> The LORD brought Israel out of Egypt by a prophet,
> And due to a prophet Israel was preserved alive.
###### 14
> But Ephraim bitterly provoked him to anger;
> So he will hold him accountable for the blood he has shed,
> His Lord will repay him for the contempt he has shown.
