# Micah 3
## God Will Judge Judah’s Sinful Leaders
###### ¶ 1
> I said,
> “Listen, you leaders of Jacob,
> “You rulers of the nation of Israel!
> “You ought to know what is just,
###### 2
> “Yet you hate what is good
> “And love what is evil.
> “You flay my people’s skin
> “And rip the flesh from their bones.
###### 3
> “You devour my people’s flesh,
> “Strip off their skin,
> “And crush their bones.
> “You chop them up like flesh in a pot—
> “Like meat in a kettle.
###### 4
> “Someday these sinful leaders will cry to the LORD for help,
> “But he will not answer them.
> “He will hide his face from them at that time,
> “Because they have done such wicked deeds.”
###### ¶ 5
This is what the LORD has said about the prophets who mislead my people,
> “If someone gives them enough to eat,
> “They offer an oracle of peace.
> “But if someone does not give them food,
> “They are ready to declare war on him.
###### 6
> “Therefore night will fall, and you will receive no visions;
> “It will grow dark, and you will no longer be able to read the omens.
> “The sun will set on these prophets,
> “And the daylight will turn to darkness over their heads.
###### 7
> “The prophets will be ashamed;
> “The omen readers will be humiliated.
> “All of them will cover their mouths,
> “For they will receive no divine oracles.”
###### 8
> But I am full of the courage that the LORD’s Spirit gives
> And have a strong commitment to justice.
> This enables me to confront Jacob with its rebellion
> And Israel with its sin.
###### 9
> Listen to this, you leaders of the family of Jacob,
> You rulers of the nation of Israel!
> You hate justice
> And pervert all that is right.
###### 10
> You build Zion through bloody crimes,
> Jerusalem through unjust violence.
###### 11
> Her leaders take bribes when they decide legal cases,
> Her priests proclaim rulings for profit,
> And her prophets read omens for pay.
> Yet they claim to trust the LORD and say,
> “The LORD is among us.
> “Disaster will not overtake us!”
###### 12
> Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed up like a field,
> Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,
> And the Temple Mount will become a hill overgrown with brush!
