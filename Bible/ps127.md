# Psalm 127
###### ¶ 1
> If the LORD does not build a house,
> Then those who build it work in vain.
> If the LORD does not guard a city,
> Then the watchman stands guard in vain.
###### 2
> It is vain for you to rise early, come home late,
> And work so hard for your food.
> Yes, he provides for those whom he loves even when they sleep.
###### ¶ 3
> Yes, sons are a gift from the LORD;
> The fruit of the womb is a reward.
###### 4
> Sons born during one’s youth
> Are like arrows in a warrior’s hand.
###### 5
> How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them.
> They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate.
