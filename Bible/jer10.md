# Jeremiah 10
## The Lord, not Idols, is the Only Worthy Object of Worship
###### ¶ 1
You people of Israel, listen to what the LORD has to say to you.
###### 2
The LORD says:
> “Do not start following pagan religious practices.
> “Do not be in awe of signs that occur in the sky
> “Even though the nations hold them in awe.
###### 3
> “For the religion of these people is worthless.
> “They cut down a tree in the forest,
> “And a craftsman makes it into an idol with his tools.
###### 4
> “He decorates it with overlays of silver and gold.
> “He uses hammer and nails to fasten it together
> “So that it will not fall over.
###### 5
> “Such idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field.
> “They cannot talk.
> “They must be carried
> “Because they cannot walk.
> “Do not be afraid of them
> “Because they cannot hurt you.
> “And they do not have any power to help you.”
###### ¶ 6
I said,
> “There is no one like you, LORD.
> “You are great,
> “And you are renowned for your power.
###### 7
> “Everyone should revere you, O King of all nations,
> “Because you deserve to be revered.
> “For there is no one like you
> “Among any of the wise people of the nations nor among any of their kings.
###### 8
> “The people of those nations are both stupid and foolish.
> “Instruction from a wooden idol is worthless!
###### 9
> “Hammered-out silver is brought from Tarshish
> “And gold is brought from Ufaz to cover those idols.
> “They are the handiwork of carpenters and goldsmiths.
> “They are clothed in blue and purple clothes.
> “They are all made by skillful workers.
###### 10
> “The LORD is the only true God.
> “He is the living God and the everlasting King.
> “When he shows his anger the earth shakes.
> “None of the nations can stand up to his fury.
###### ¶ 11
> “You people of Israel should tell those nations this:
> ‘These gods did not make heaven and earth.
> ‘They will disappear from the earth and from under the heavens.’
###### ¶ 12
> “The LORD is the one who by his power made the earth.
> “He is the one who by his wisdom established the world.
> “And by his understanding he spread out the skies.
###### 13
> “When his voice thunders, the heavenly ocean roars.
> “He makes the clouds rise from the far-off horizons.
> “He makes the lightning flash out in the midst of the rain.
> “He unleashes the wind from the places where he stores it.
###### 14
> “All these idolaters will prove to be stupid and ignorant.
> “Every goldsmith will be disgraced by the idol he made.
> “For the image he forges is merely a sham.
> “There is no breath in any of those idols.
###### 15
> “They are worthless, mere objects to be mocked.
> “When the time comes to punish them, they will be destroyed.
###### 16
> “The LORD, who is the inheritance of Jacob’s descendants, is not like them.
> “He is the one who created everything.
> “And the people of Israel are those he claims as his own.
> “His name is the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.”
## Jeremiah Laments for and Prays for the People Soon to be Judged
###### ¶ 17
> “Gather your belongings together and prepare to leave the land,
> “You people of Jerusalem who are being besieged.
###### 18
> “For the LORD says, ‘I will now throw out
> ‘Those who live in this land.
> ‘I will bring so much trouble on them
> ‘That they will actually feel it.’
###### ¶ 19
> “And I cried out, ‘We are doomed!
> ‘Our wound is severe!’
> “We once thought, ‘This is only an illness.
> ‘And we will be able to bear it.’
###### 20
> “But our tents have been destroyed.
> “The ropes that held them in place have been ripped apart.
> “Our children are gone and are not coming back.
> “There is no survivor to put our tents back up,
> “No one left to hang their tent curtains in place.
###### 21
> “For our leaders are stupid.
> “They have not sought the LORD’s advice.
> “So they do not act wisely,
> “And the people they are responsible for have all been scattered.
###### 22
> “Listen! News is coming even now.
> “The rumble of a great army is heard approaching from a land in the north.
> “It is coming to turn the towns of Judah into rubble,
> “Places where only jackals live.
###### ¶ 23
> “LORD, we know that people do not control their own destiny.
> “It is not in their power to determine what will happen to them.
###### 24
> “Correct us, LORD, but only in due measure.
> “Do not punish us in anger or you will reduce us to nothing.
###### 25
> “Vent your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you.
> “Vent it on the peoples who do not worship you.
> “For they have destroyed the people of Jacob.
> “They have completely destroyed them
> “And left their homeland in utter ruin.”
