# Isaiah 17
## The Lord Will Judge Damascus
###### ¶ 1
> This is an oracle about Damascus:
>  “ Look, Damascus is no longer a city,
>  “ It is a heap of ruins!
###### 2
>  “ The cities of Aroer are abandoned.
>  “ They will be used for herds,
>  “ Which will lie down there in peace.
###### 3
>  “ Fortified cities will disappear from Ephraim,
>  “ And Damascus will lose its kingdom.
>  “ The survivors in Syria
>  “ Will end up like the splendor of the Israelites,”
> Says the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.
###### ¶ 4
>  “ At that time
>  “ Jacob’s splendor will be greatly diminished,
>  “ And he will become skin and bones.
###### 5
>  “ It will be as when one gathers the grain harvest,
>  “ And his hand gleans the ear of grain.
>  “ It will be like one gathering the ears of grain
>  “ In the Valley of Rephaim.
###### 6
>  “ There will be some left behind,
>  “ As when an olive tree is beaten—
>  “ Two or three ripe olives remain toward the very top,
>  “ Four or five on its fruitful branches,”
> Says the LORD God of Israel.
###### 7
> At that time men will trust in their Creator;
> They will depend on the Holy One of Israel.
###### 8
> They will no longer trust in the altars their hands made,
> Or depend on the Asherah poles and incense altars their fingers made.
###### 9
> At that time their fortified cities will be
> Like the abandoned summits of the Amorites,
> Which they abandoned because of the Israelites;
> There will be desolation.
###### 10
> For you ignore the God who rescues you;
> You pay no attention to your strong protector.
> So this is what happens:
> You cultivate beautiful plants
> And plant exotic vines.
###### 11
> The day you begin cultivating, you do what you can to make it grow;
> The morning you begin planting, you do what you can to make it sprout.
> Yet the harvest will disappear in the day of disease
> And incurable pain.
###### ¶ 12
> Beware, you many nations massing together,
> Those who make a commotion as loud as the roaring of the sea’s waves.
> Beware, you people making such an uproar,
> Those who make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves.
###### 13
> Though these people make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves,
> When he shouts at them, they will flee to a distant land,
> Driven before the wind like dead weeds on the hills,
> Or like dead thistles before a strong gale.
###### 14
> In the evening there is sudden terror;
> By morning they vanish.
> This is the fate of those who try to plunder us,
> The destiny of those who try to loot us!
