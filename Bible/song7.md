# Song of Songs 7
###### ¶ 1
>  How beautiful are your sandaled feet,
> O nobleman’s daughter!
> The curves of your thighs are like jewels,
> The work of the hands of a master craftsman.
###### 2
> Your navel is a round mixing bowl—
> May it never lack mixed wine!
> Your belly is a mound of wheat,
> Encircled by lilies.
###### 3
> Your two breasts are like two fawns,
> Twins of a gazelle.
###### 4
> Your neck is like a tower made of ivory.
> Your eyes are the pools in Heshbon
> By the gate of Bath Rabbim.
> Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
> Overlooking Damascus.
###### 5
> Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel.
> The locks of your hair are like royal tapestries—
> The king is held captive in its tresses!
###### 6
> How beautiful you are! How lovely,
> O love, with your delights!
## The Palm Tree and the Palm Tree Climber
###### 7
> Your stature is like a palm tree,
> And your breasts are like clusters of grapes.
###### 8
> I want to climb the palm tree,
> And take hold of its fruit stalks.
> May your breasts be like the clusters of grapes,
> And may the fragrance of your breath be like apples!
###### 9
> May your mouth be like the best wine,
> Flowing smoothly for my beloved,
> Gliding gently over our lips as we sleep together.
## Poetic Refrain: Mutual Possession
###### ¶ 10
> I am my beloved’s,
> And he desires me!
## The Journey to the Countryside
###### 11
> Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside;
> Let us spend the night in the villages.
###### 12
> Let us rise early to go to the vineyards,
> To see if the vines have budded,
> To see if their blossoms have opened,
> If the pomegranates are in bloom—
> There I will give you my love.
###### 13
> The mandrakes send out their fragrance;
> Over our door is every delicacy,
> Both new and old, which I have stored up for you, my lover.
