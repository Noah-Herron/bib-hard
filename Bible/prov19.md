# Proverbs 19
###### ¶ 1
> Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity
> Than one who is perverse in his speech and is a fool.
###### 2
> It is dangerous to have zeal without knowledge,
> And the one who acts hastily makes poor choices.
###### 3
> A person’s folly subverts his way,
> And his heart rages against the LORD.
###### 4
> Wealth adds many friends,
> But a poor person is separated from his friend.
###### 5
> A false witness will not go unpunished,
> And the one who spouts out lies will not escape punishment.
###### 6
> Many people entreat the favor of a generous person,
> And everyone is the friend of the person who gives gifts.
###### 7
> All the relatives of a poor person hate him;
> How much more do his friends avoid him—
> One who chases words, which are nothing.
###### 8
> The one who acquires understanding loves himself;
> The one who preserves understanding will prosper.
###### 9
> A false witness will not go unpunished,
> And the one who spouts out lies will perish.
###### 10
> Luxury is not appropriate for a fool;
> How much less for a servant to rule over princes!
###### 11
> A person’s wisdom has made him slow to anger,
> And it is his glory to overlook an offense.
###### 12
> A king’s wrath is like the roar of a lion,
> But his favor is like dew on the grass.
###### 13
> A foolish child is the ruin of his father,
> And a contentious wife is like a constant dripping.
###### 14
> A house and wealth are inherited from parents,
> But a prudent wife is from the LORD.
###### 15
> Laziness brings on a deep sleep,
> And the idle person will go hungry.
###### 16
> The one who obeys commandments guards his life;
> The one who despises his ways will die.
###### 17
> The one who is gracious to the poor lends to the LORD,
> And the LORD will repay him for his good deed.
###### 18
> Discipline your child, for there is hope,
> But do not set your heart on causing his death.
###### 19
> A person with great anger bears the penalty,
> But if you deliver him from it once, you will have to do it again.
###### 20
> Listen to advice and receive discipline,
> That you may become wise by the end of your life.
###### 21
> There are many plans in a person’s mind,
> But it is the counsel of the LORD that will stand.
###### 22
> What is desirable for a person is to show loyal love,
> And a poor person is better than a liar.
###### 23
> Fearing the LORD leads to life,
> And one who does so will live satisfied; he will not be afflicted by calamity.
###### 24
> The sluggard has plunged his hand into the dish,
> And he will not even bring it back to his mouth!
###### 25
> Flog a scorner, and as a result the simpleton will learn prudence;
> Correct a discerning person, and as a result he will understand knowledge.
###### 26
> The one who robs his father and chases away his mother
> Is a son who brings shame and disgrace.
###### 27
> If you stop listening to instruction, my child,
> You will stray from the words of knowledge.
###### 28
> A crooked witness scorns justice,
> And the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.
###### 29
> Penalties have been prepared for scorners,
> And floggings for the backs of fools.
