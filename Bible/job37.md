# Job 37
###### ¶ 1
> At this also my heart pounds
> And leaps from its place.
###### 2
> Listen carefully to the thunder of his voice,
> To the rumbling that proceeds from his mouth.
###### 3
> Under the whole heaven he lets it go,
> Even his lightning to the far corners of the earth.
###### 4
> After that a voice roars;
> He thunders with an exalted voice,
> And he does not hold back his lightning bolts
> When his voice is heard.
###### 5
> God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways;
> He does great things beyond our understanding.
###### 6
> For to the snow he says, ‘Fall to earth,’
>  “ And to the torrential rains, ‘Pour down.’
###### 7
>  “ He causes everyone to stop working,
>  “ So that all people may know his work.
###### 8
>  “ The wild animals go to their lairs,
>  “ And in their dens they remain.
###### 9
>  “ A tempest blows out from its chamber,
>  “ Icy cold from the driving winds.
###### 10
>  “ The breath of God produces ice,
>  “ And the breadth of the waters freeze solid.
###### 11
>  “ He loads the clouds with moisture;
>  “ He scatters his lightning through the clouds.
###### 12
>  “ The clouds go round in circles,
>  “ Wheeling about according to his plans,
>  “ To carry out all that he commands them
>  “ Over the face of the whole inhabited world.
###### 13
>  “ Whether it is for punishment,
>  “ Or for his land,
>  “ Or for mercy,
>  “ He causes it to find its mark.
###### ¶ 14
>  “ Pay attention to this, Job!
>  “ Stand still and consider the wonders God works.
###### 15
>  “ Do you know how God commands them,
>  “ How he makes lightning flash in his storm cloud?
###### 16
>  “ Do you know about the balancing of the clouds,
>  “ That wondrous activity of him who is perfect in knowledge?
###### 17
>  “ You, whose garments are hot
>  “ When the earth is still because of the south wind,
###### 18
>  “ Will you, with him, spread out the clouds,
>  “ Solid as a mirror of molten metal?
###### 19
>  “ Tell us what we should say to him.
>  “ We cannot prepare a case
>  “ Because of the darkness.
###### 20
>  “ Should he be informed that I want to speak?
>  “ If a man speaks, surely he will be swallowed up!
###### ¶ 21
>  “ But now, the sun cannot be looked at—
>  “ It is bright in the skies—
>  “ After a wind passed and swept the clouds away.
###### 22
>  “ From the north he comes in golden splendor;
>  “ Around God is awesome majesty.
###### 23
>  “ As for the Almighty, we cannot attain to him!
>  “ He is great in power,
>  “ But justice and abundant righteousness he does not oppress.
###### 24
>  “ Therefore people fear him,
>  “ For he does not regard all the wise in heart.”
