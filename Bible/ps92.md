# Psalm 92
###### ¶ 1
> It is fitting to thank the LORD,
> And to sing praises to your name, O Most High.
###### 2
> It is fitting to proclaim your loyal love in the morning,
> And your faithfulness during the night,
###### 3
> To the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre,
> To the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the harp.
###### 4
> For you, O LORD, have made me happy by your work.
> I will sing for joy because of what you have done.
###### ¶ 5
> How great are your works, O LORD!
> Your plans are very intricate!
###### 6
> The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this;
> The fool does not understand this.
###### 7
> When the wicked sprout up like grass,
> And all the evildoers glisten,
> It is so that they may be annihilated.
###### 8
> But you, O LORD, reign forever.
###### 9
> Indeed, look at your enemies, O LORD.
> Indeed, look at how your enemies perish.
> All the evildoers are scattered.
###### ¶ 10
> You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox.
> I am covered with fresh oil.
###### 11
> I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me;
> I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked me.
###### 12
> The godly grow like a palm tree;
> They grow high like a cedar in Lebanon.
###### 13
> Planted in the LORD’s house,
> They grow in the courts of our God.
###### 14
> They bear fruit even when they are old;
> They are filled with vitality and have many leaves.
###### 15
> So they proclaim that the LORD, my Protector,
> Is just and never unfair.
