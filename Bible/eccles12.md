# Ecclesiastes 12
## Fear God Now Because Old Age and Death Come Quickly
###### ¶ 1
> So remember your Creator in the days of your youth—
> Before the difficult days come,
> And the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
###### 2
> Before the sun and the light of the moon and the stars grow dark,
> And the clouds disappear after the rain;
###### 3
> When those who keep watch over the house begin to tremble,
> And the virile men begin to stoop over,
> And the grinders begin to cease because they grow few,
> And those who look through the windows grow dim,
###### 4
> And the doors along the street are shut;
> When the sound of the grinding mill grows low,
> And one is awakened by the sound of a bird,
> And all their songs grow faint,
###### 5
> And they are afraid of heights and the dangers in the street;
> The almond blossoms grow white,
> And the grasshopper drags itself along,
> And the caper berry shrivels up—
> Because man goes to his eternal home,
> And the mourners go about in the streets—
###### 6
> Before the silver cord is removed,
> Or the golden bowl is broken,
> Or the pitcher is shattered at the well,
> Or the water wheel is broken at the cistern—
###### 7
> And the dust returns to the earth as it was,
> And the life’s breath returns to God who gave it.
## Concluding Refrain: The Teacher Restates His Thesis
###### 8
> “Absolutely futile!” laments the Teacher,
> “All these things are futile!”
## Concluding Epilogue: The Teacher’s Advice is Wise
###### ¶ 9
> Not only was the Teacher wise,
> But he also taught knowledge to the people;
> He carefully evaluated and arranged many proverbs.
###### 10
> The Teacher sought to find delightful words,
> And to write accurately truthful sayings.
###### ¶ 11
> The words of the sages are like prods,
> And the collected sayings are like firmly fixed nails;
> They are given by one shepherd.
## Concluding Exhortation: Fear God and Obey His Commands
###### 12
> Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.
> There is no end to the making of many books,
> And much study is exhausting to the body.
###### ¶ 13
> Having heard everything, I have reached this conclusion:
> Fear God and keep his commandments,
> Because this is the whole duty of man.
###### 14
> For God will evaluate every deed,
> Including every secret thing, whether good or evil.
