# Isaiah 26
## Judah Will Celebrate
###### ¶ 1
> At that time this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
>  “ We have a strong city!
>  “ The LORD’s deliverance, like walls and a rampart, makes it secure.
###### 2
>  “ Open the gates so a righteous nation can enter—
>  “ One that remains trustworthy.
###### 3
>  “ You keep completely safe the people who maintain their faith,
>  “ For they trust in you.
###### 4
>  “ Trust in the LORD from this time forward,
>  “ Even in YAH, the LORD, an enduring protector!
###### 5
>  “ Indeed, the LORD knocks down those who live in a high place,
>  “ He brings down an elevated town;
>  “ He brings it down to the ground,
>  “ He throws it down to the dust.
###### 6
>  “ It is trampled underfoot
>  “ By the feet of the oppressed,
>  “ By the soles of the poor.”
## God’s People Anticipate Vindication
###### ¶ 7
> The way of the righteous is level,
> The path of the righteous that you prepare is straight.
###### 8
> Yes, as your judgments unfold,
> O LORD, we wait for you.
> We desire your fame and reputation to grow.
###### 9
> I look for you during the night;
> My spirit within me seeks you at dawn,
> For when your judgments come upon the earth,
> Those who live in the world learn about justice.
###### 10
> If the wicked are shown mercy,
> They do not learn about justice.
> Even in a land where right is rewarded, they act unjustly;
> They do not see the LORD’s majesty revealed.
###### ¶ 11
> O LORD, you are ready to act,
> But they don’t even notice.
>  “ They will see and be put to shame by your angry judgment against humankind;
>  “ Yes, fire will consume your enemies.
###### 12
>  “ O LORD, you make us secure,
>  “ For even all we have accomplished, you have done for us.
###### 13
>  “ O LORD, our God,
>  “ Masters other than you have ruled us,
>  “ But we praise your name alone.
###### 14
>  “ The dead do not come back to life,
>  “ The spirits of the dead do not rise.
>  “ That is because you came in judgment and destroyed them,
>  “ You wiped out all memory of them.
###### 15
>  “ You have made the nation larger, O LORD;
>  “ You have made the nation larger and revealed your splendor;
>  “ You have extended all the borders of the land.
###### 16
>  “ O LORD, in distress they looked for you;
>  “ They uttered incantations because of your discipline.
###### 17
>  “ As when a pregnant woman gets ready to deliver
>  “ And strains and cries out because of her labor pains,
>  “ So were we because of you, O LORD.
###### 18
>  “ We were pregnant, we strained,
>  “ We gave birth, as it were, to wind.
>  “ We cannot produce deliverance on the earth;
>  “ No people are born to populate the world.
###### 19
>  “ Your dead will come back to life;
>  “ Your corpses will rise up.
>  “ Wake up and shout joyfully, you who live in the ground!
>  “ For you will grow like plants drenched with the morning dew,
>  “ And the earth will bring forth its dead spirits.
###### ¶ 20
>  “ Go, my people! Enter your inner rooms!
>  “ Close your doors behind you!
>  “ Hide for a little while,
>  “ Until his angry judgment is over.
###### 21
>  “ For look, the LORD is coming out of the place where he lives,
>  “ To punish the sin of those who live on the earth.
>  “ The earth will display the blood shed on it;
>  “ It will no longer cover up its slain.
