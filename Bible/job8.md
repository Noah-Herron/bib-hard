# Job 8
## Bildad’s First Speech to Job
###### ¶ 1
Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said:
###### 2
>  “ How long will you speak these things,
>  “ Seeing that the words of your mouth
>  “ Are like a great wind?
###### 3
>  “ Does God pervert justice?
>  “ Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
###### 4
>  “ If your children sinned against him,
>  “ He gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
###### 5
>  “ But if you will look to God,
>  “ And make your supplication to the Almighty,
###### 6
>  “ If you become pure and upright,
>  “ Even now he will rouse himself for you,
>  “ And will restore your righteous home.
###### 7
>  “ Your beginning will seem so small,
>  “ Since your future will flourish.
###### ¶ 8
>  “ For inquire now of the former generation,
>  “ And pay attention to the findings
>  “ Of their ancestors;
###### 9
>  “ For we were born yesterday and do not have knowledge,
>  “ Since our days on earth are but a shadow.
###### 10
>  “ Will they not instruct you and speak to you,
>  “ And bring forth words
>  “ From their understanding?
###### ¶ 11
>  “ Can the papyrus plant grow tall where there is no marsh?
>  “ Can reeds flourish without water?
###### 12
>  “ While they are still beginning to flower
>  “ And not ripe for cutting,
>  “ They can wither away
>  “ Faster than any grass.
###### 13
>  “ Such is the destiny of all who forget God;
>  “ The hope of the godless perishes,
###### 14
>  “ Whose trust is in something futile,
>  “ Whose security is a spider’s web.
###### 15
>  “ He leans against his house but it does not hold up,
>  “ He takes hold of it but it does not stand.
###### 16
>  “ He is a well-watered plant in the sun,
>  “ Its shoots spread over its garden.
###### 17
>  “ It wraps its roots around a heap of stones
>  “ And it looks for a place among stones.
###### 18
>  “ If he is uprooted from his place,
>  “ Then that place will disown him, saying,
>  ‘ I have never seen you!’
###### 19
>  “ Indeed, this is the joy of his way,
>  “ And out of the earth others spring up.
###### 20
>  “ Surely, God does not reject a blameless man,
>  “ Nor does he grasp the hand
>  “ Of the evildoers.
###### 21
>  “ He will yet fill your mouth with laughter,
>  “ And your lips with gladness.
###### 22
>  “ Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
>  “ And the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
