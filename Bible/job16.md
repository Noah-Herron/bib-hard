Then Job replied:
###### 2
> “I have heard many things like these before.
> “What miserable comforters are you all!
###### 3
> “Will there be an end to your windy words?
> “Or what provokes you that you answer?
###### 4
> “I also could speak like you,
> “If you were in my place;
> “I could pile up words against you
> “And I could shake my head at you.
###### 5
> “But I would strengthen you with my words;
> “Comfort from my lips would bring you relief.”
## Abandonment by God and Man
###### ¶ 6
> “But if I speak, my pain is not relieved,
> “And if I refrain from speaking,
> “How much of it goes away?
###### 7
> “Surely now he has worn me out,
> “You have devastated my entire household.
###### 8
> “You have seized me,
> “And it has become a witness;
> “My leanness has risen up against me
> “And testifies against me.
###### 9
> “His anger has torn me and persecuted me;
> “He has gnashed at me with his teeth;
> “My adversary locks his eyes on me.
###### 10
> “People have opened their mouths against me,
> “They have struck my cheek in scorn;
> “They unite together against me.
###### 11
> “God abandons me to evil men,
> “And throws me into the hands of wicked men.
###### 12
> “I was in peace, and he has shattered me.
> “He has seized me by the neck and crushed me.
> “He has made me his target;
###### 13
> “His archers surround me.
> “Without pity he pierces my kidneys
> “And pours out my gall on the ground.
###### 14

> “He rushes against me like a warrior.
###### 15

> “And buried my horn in the dust;
###### 16
> “My face is reddened because of weeping,
> “And on my eyelids there is a deep darkness,
###### 17
> “Although there is no violence in my hands
> “And my prayer is pure.”

###### ¶ 18

> “Nor let there be a secret place for my cry.
###### 19
> “Even now my witness is in heaven;
> “My advocate is on high.
###### 20
> “My intercessor is my friend
> “As my eyes pour out tears to God;
###### 21
> “And he contends with God on behalf of man
> “As a man pleads for his friend.
###### 22
> “For the years that lie ahead are few,
> “And then I will go on the way of no return.
