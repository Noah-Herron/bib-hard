# Isaiah 64
###### ¶ 1
>  If only you would tear apart the sky and come down!
> The mountains would tremble before you!
###### 2
>  As when fire ignites dry wood,
> Or fire makes water boil,
> Let your adversaries know who you are,
> And may the nations shake at your presence!
###### 3
> When you performed awesome deeds that took us by surprise,
> You came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
###### 4
> Since ancient times no one has heard or perceived,
> No eye has seen any God besides you,
> Who intervenes for those who wait for him.
###### 5
> You assist those who delight in doing what is right,
> Who observe your commandments.
> Look, you were angry because we violated them continually.
> How then can we be saved?
###### 6
> We are all like one who is unclean,
> All our so-called righteous acts are like a menstrual rag in your sight.
> We all wither like a leaf;
> Our sins carry us away like the wind.
###### 7
> No one invokes your name,
> Or makes an effort to take hold of you.
> For you have rejected us
> And handed us over to our own sins.
###### ¶ 8
> Yet, LORD, you are our father.
> We are the clay, and you are our potter;
> We are all the product of your labor.
###### 9
> LORD, do not be too angry!
> Do not hold our sins against us continually.
> Take a good look at your people, at all of us.
###### 10
> Your chosen cities have become a wilderness;
> Zion has become a wilderness,
> Jerusalem, a desolate ruin.
###### 11
> Our holy temple, our pride and joy,
> The place where our ancestors praised you,
> Has been burned with fire;
> All our prized possessions have been destroyed.
###### 12
> In light of all this, how can you still hold back, LORD?
> How can you be silent and continue to humiliate us?
