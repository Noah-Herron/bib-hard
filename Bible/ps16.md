# Psalm 16
###### ¶ 1
> Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you.
###### 2
> I say to the LORD, “You are the Lord,
>  “ My only source of well-being.”
###### 3
> As for God’s chosen people who are in the land,
> And the leading officials I admired so much—
###### 4
> Their troubles multiply;
> They desire other gods.
> I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods,
> Nor will I make vows in the name of their gods.
###### ¶ 5
> LORD, you give me stability and prosperity;
> You make my future secure.
###### 6
> It is as if I have been given fertile fields
> Or received a beautiful tract of land.
###### ¶ 7
> I will praise the LORD who guides me;
> Yes, during the night I reflect and learn.
###### 8
> I constantly trust in the LORD;
> Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
###### 9
> So my heart rejoices
> And I am happy;
> My life is safe.
###### 10
> You will not abandon me to Sheol;
> You will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit.
###### 11
> You lead me in the path of life.
> I experience absolute joy in your presence;
> You always give me sheer delight.
