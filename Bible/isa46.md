# Isaiah 46
## The Lord Carries His People
###### ¶ 1
> Bel kneels down,
> Nebo bends low.
> Their images weigh down animals and beasts.
> Your heavy images are burdensome to tired animals.
###### 2
> Together they bend low and kneel down;
> They are unable to rescue the images;
> They themselves head off into captivity.
###### ¶ 3
>  “ Listen to me, O family of Jacob,
>  “ All you who are left from the family of Israel,
>  “ You who have been carried from birth,
>  “ You who have been supported from the time you left the womb.
###### 4
>  “ Even when you are old, I will take care of you,
>  “ Even when you have gray hair, I will carry you.
>  “ I made you and I will support you;
>  “ I will carry you and rescue you.
###### ¶ 5
>  “ To whom can you compare and liken me?
>  “ Tell me whom you think I resemble, so we can be compared!
###### 6
>  “ Those who empty out gold from a purse
>  “ And weigh out silver on the scale
>  “ Hire a metalsmith, who makes it into a god.
>  “ They then bow down and worship it.
###### 7
>  “ They put it on their shoulder and carry it;
>  “ They put it in its place and it just stands there;
>  “ It does not move from its place.
>  “ Even when someone cries out to it, it does not reply;
>  “ It does not deliver him from his distress.
###### ¶ 8
>  “ Remember this, so you can be brave.
>  “ Think about it, you rebels!
###### 9
>  “ Remember what I accomplished in antiquity.
>  “ Truly I am God, I have no peer;
>  “ I am God, and there is none like me,
###### 10
>  “ Who announces the end from the beginning
>  “ And reveals beforehand what has not yet occurred;
>  “ Who says, ‘My plan will be realized,
>  ‘ I will accomplish what I desire;’
###### 11
>  “ Who summons an eagle from the east,
>  “ From a distant land, one who carries out my plan.
>  “ Yes, I have decreed,
>  “ Yes, I will bring it to pass;
>  “ I have formulated a plan,
>  “ Yes, I will carry it out.
###### ¶ 12
>  “ Listen to me, you stubborn people,
>  “ You who distance yourselves from doing what is right.
###### 13
>  “ I am bringing my deliverance near, it is not far away;
>  “ I am bringing my salvation near, it does not wait.
>  “ I will save Zion;
>  “ I will adorn Israel with my splendor.
