# Amos 5
## Death is Imminent
###### ¶ 1
Listen to this funeral song I am ready to sing about you, family of Israel:
###### 2
>  “ The virgin Israel has fallen down and will not get up again.
>  “ She is abandoned on her own land
>  “ With no one to help her get up.”
###### 3
The Sovereign LORD says this:
>  “ The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers will have only a hundred left;
>  “ The town that marches out with a hundred soldiers will have only ten left for the family of Israel.”
###### ¶ 4
The LORD says this to the family of Israel:
>  “ Seek me so you can live!
###### 5
>  “ Do not seek Bethel.
>  “ Do not visit Gilgal.
>  “ Do not journey down to Beer Sheba.
>  “ For the people of Gilgal will certainly be carried into exile,
>  “ And Bethel will become a place where disaster abounds.”
###### 6
> Seek the LORD so you can live!
> Otherwise he will break out like fire against Joseph’s family;
> The fire will consume
> And no one will be able to quench it and save Bethel.
###### 7
> The Israelites turn justice into bitterness;
> They throw what is fair and right to the ground.
###### ¶ 8
> But there is one who made the constellations Pleiades and Orion;
> He can turn the darkness into morning
> And daylight into night.
> He summons the water of the seas
> And pours it out on the earth’s surface.
> The LORD is his name!
###### 9
> He flashes destruction down upon the strong
> So that destruction overwhelms the fortified places.
###### ¶ 10
> The Israelites hate anyone who arbitrates at the city gate;
> They despise anyone who speaks honestly.
###### 11
> Therefore, because you make the poor pay taxes on their crops
> And exact a grain tax from them,
> You will not live in the houses you built with chiseled stone,
> Nor will you drink the wine from the fine vineyards you planted.
###### 12
> Certainly I am aware of your many rebellious acts
> And your numerous sins.
> You torment the innocent, you take bribes,
> And you deny justice to the needy at the city gate.
###### 13
> For this reason whoever is smart keeps quiet in such a time,
> For it is an evil time.
###### ¶ 14
> Seek good and not evil so you can live!
> Then the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies just might be with you,
> As you claim he is.
###### 15
> Hate what is wrong, love what is right.
> Promote justice at the city gate.
> Maybe the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies will have mercy on those who are left from Joseph.
###### ¶ 16
Because of Israel’s sins this is what the Lord, the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies, says:
>  “ In all the squares there will be wailing,
>  “ In all the streets they will mourn the dead.
>  “ They will tell the field workers to lament
>  “ And the professional mourners to wail.
###### 17
>  “ In all the vineyards there will be wailing,
>  “ For I will pass through your midst,” says the LORD.
## The Lord Demands Justice
###### ¶ 18
> Woe to those who wish for the day of the LORD!
> Why do you want the LORD’s day of judgment to come?
> It will bring darkness, not light.
###### 19
> Disaster will be inescapable,
> As if a man ran from a lion only to meet a bear,
> Then escaped into a house,
> Leaned his hand against the wall,
> And was bitten by a poisonous snake.
###### 20
> Don’t you realize the LORD’s day of judgment will bring darkness, not light—
>  “ Gloomy blackness, not bright light?
###### ¶ 21
>  “ I absolutely despise your festivals!
>  “ I get no pleasure from your religious assemblies.
###### 22
>  “ Even if you offer me burnt and grain offerings, I will not be satisfied;
>  “ I will not look with favor on your peace offerings of fattened calves.
###### 23
>  “ Take away from me your noisy songs;
>  “ I don’t want to hear the music of your stringed instruments.
###### 24
>  “ Justice must flow like torrents of water,
>  “ Righteous actions like a stream that never dries up.
###### ¶ 25
>  “ You did not bring me sacrifices and grain offerings during the forty years you spent in the wilderness, family of Israel.
###### 26
>  “ You will pick up your images of Sikkuth, your king,
>  “ And Kiyyun, your star god, which you made for yourselves,
###### 27
>  “ And I will drive you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the LORD.
> He is called the God of Heaven’s Armies.
