# Proverbs 21
###### ¶ 1
> The king’s heart is in the hand of the LORD like channels of water;
> He turns it wherever he wants.
###### 2
> All a person’s ways seem right in his own opinion,
> But the LORD evaluates his thoughts.
###### 3
> To do righteousness and justice
> Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
###### 4
> Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
> What the wicked cultivate is sin.
###### 5
> The plans of the diligent lead only to plenty,
> But everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.
###### 6
> Making a fortune by a lying tongue is like a vapor driven back and forth;
> They seek death.
###### 7
> The violence done by the wicked will drag them away
> Because they have refused to do what is right.
###### 8
> The way of the guilty person is devious,
> But as for the pure, his way is upright.
###### 9
> It is better to live on a corner of the housetop
> Than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
###### 10
> The appetite of the wicked has desired evil;
> His neighbor is shown no favor in his eyes.
###### 11
> When a scorner is punished, the naive becomes wise;
> When a wise person is instructed, he gains knowledge.
###### 12
> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked;
> He overthrows the wicked to their ruin.
###### 13
> The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,
> He too will cry out and will not be answered.
###### 14
> A gift given in secret subdues anger,
> And a bribe given secretly subdues strong wrath.
###### 15
> Doing justice brings joy to the righteous
> And terror to those who do evil.
###### 16
> The one who wanders from the way of wisdom
> Will end up in the company of the departed.
###### 17
> The one who loves pleasure will be a poor person;
> Whoever loves wine and anointing oil will not be rich.
###### 18
> The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,
> And the treacherous are taken in the place of the upright.
###### 19
> It is better to live in the wilderness
> Than with a quarrelsome and easily provoked woman.
###### 20
> There is desirable treasure and olive oil in the dwelling of the wise,
> But a foolish person devours all he has.
###### 21
> The one who pursues righteousness and love
> Finds life, bounty, and honor.
###### 22
> A wise man went up against the city of the mighty
> And brought down the stronghold in which they trust.
###### 23
> The one who guards his mouth and his tongue
> Keeps his life from troubles.
###### 24
> A proud and arrogant person, whose name is “Scoffer,”
> Acts with overbearing pride.
###### 25
> What the sluggard desires will kill him,
> For his hands have refused to work.
###### 26
> All day long he has craved greedily,
> But the righteous person gives and does not hold back.
###### 27
> The wicked person’s sacrifice is an abomination;
> How much more when he brings it with evil intent!
###### 28
> A lying witness will perish,
> But the one who reports accurately speaks forever.
###### 29
> A wicked person has put on a bold face,
> But as for the upright, he establishes his ways.
###### 30
> There is no wisdom and there is no understanding,
> And there is no counsel against the LORD.
###### 31
> A horse is prepared for the day of battle,
> But the victory is from the LORD.
