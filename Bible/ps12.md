# Psalm 12
###### ¶ 1
> Deliver, LORD!
> For the godly have disappeared;
> People of integrity have vanished.
###### 2
> People lie to one another;
> They flatter and deceive.
###### 3
> May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,
> And the tongue that boasts!
###### 4
> They say, “We speak persuasively;
>  “ We know how to flatter and boast.
>  “ Who is our master?”
###### 5
>  “ Because of the violence done to the oppressed,
>  “ Because of the painful cries of the needy,
>  “ I will spring into action,” says the LORD.
>  “ I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.”
###### ¶ 6
> The LORD’s words are absolutely reliable.
> They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground,
> Where it is thoroughly refined.
###### 7
> You, LORD, will protect them;
> You will continually shelter each one from these evil people,
###### 8
> For the wicked seem to be everywhere,
> When people promote evil.
