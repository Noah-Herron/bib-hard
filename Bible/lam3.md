# Lamentations 3
## The Prophet Speaks
###### ¶ 1
> I am the man who has experienced affliction
> From the rod of theLORD’s wrath.
###### 2
> He drove me into captivity and made me walk
> In darkness and not light.
###### 3
> He repeatedly attacks me;
> He turns his hand against me all day long.
###### 4
> He has made my mortal skin waste away;
> He has broken my bones.
###### 5
> He has besieged and surrounded me
> With bitter hardship.
###### 6
> He has made me reside in deepest darkness
> Like those who died long ago.
###### 7
> He has walled me in so that I cannot get out;
> He has weighted me down with heavy prison chains.
###### 8
> Also, when I cry out desperately for help,
> He has shut out my prayer.
###### 9
> He has blocked every road I take with a wall of hewn stones;
> He has made every path impassable.
###### 10
> To me he is like a bear lying in ambush,
> Like a hidden lion stalking its prey.
###### 11
> He has obstructed my paths and torn me to pieces;
> He has made me desolate.
###### 12
> He drew his bow and made me
> The target for his arrow.
###### 13
> He shot his arrows
> Into my heart.
###### 14
> I have become the laughingstock of all people,
> Their mocking song all day long.
###### 15
> He has given me my fill of bitter herbs
> And made me drunk with bitterness.
###### 16
> He ground my teeth in gravel;
> He trampled me in the dust.
###### 17
> I am deprived of peace;
> I have forgotten what happiness is.
###### 18
> So I said, “My endurance has expired;
> “I have lost all hope of deliverance from the LORD.”
###### ¶ 19
> Remember my impoverished and homeless condition,
> Which is a bitter poison.
###### 20
> I continually think about this,
> And I am depressed.
###### 21
> But this I call to mind;
> Therefore I have hope:
###### 22
> The LORD’s loyal kindness never ceases;
> His compassions never end.
###### 23
> They are fresh every morning;
> Your faithfulness is abundant!
###### 24
> “My portion is the LORD,” I have said to myself,
> So I will put my hope in him.
###### 25
> The LORD is good to those who trust in him,
> To the one who seeks him.
###### 26
> It is good to wait patiently
> For deliverance from the LORD.
###### 27
> It is good for a man
> To bear the yoke while he is young.
###### 28
> Let a person sit alone in silence,
> When the LORD is disciplining him.
###### 29
> Let him bury his face in the dust;
> Perhaps there is hope.
###### 30
> Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him;
> Let him have his fill of insults.
###### 31
> For the Lord will not
> Reject us forever.
###### 32
> Though he causes us grief, he then has compassion on us
> According to the abundance of his loyal kindness.
###### 33
> For he is not predisposed to afflict
> Or to grieve people.
###### 34
> To crush underfoot
> All the earth’s prisoners,
###### 35
> To deprive a person of his rights
> In the presence of the Most High,
###### 36
> To defraud a person in a lawsuit—
> The Lord does not approve of such things!
###### 37
> Whose command was ever fulfilled
> Unless the Lord decreed it?
###### 38
> Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes—
> Both calamity and blessing?
###### 39
> Why should any living person complain
> When punished for his sins?
###### ¶ 40
> Let us carefully examine our ways,
> And let us return to the LORD.
###### 41
> Let us lift up our hearts and our hands
> To God in heaven:
###### 42
> “We have blatantly rebelled;
> “You have not forgiven.”
###### 43
> You shrouded yourself with anger and then pursued us;
> You killed without mercy.
###### 44
> You shrouded yourself with a cloud
> So that no prayer could get through.
###### 45
> You make us like filthy scum
> In the estimation of the nations.
###### 46
> All our enemies have gloated over us;
###### 47
> Panic and pitfall have come upon us,
> Devastation and destruction.
###### 48
> Streams of tears flow from my eyes
> Because my people are destroyed.
###### 49
> Tears flow from my eyes and will not stop;
> There will be no break
###### 50
> Until the LORD looks down from heaven
> And sees what has happened.
###### 51
> What my eyes see grieves me—
> All the suffering of the daughters in my city.
###### 52
> For no good reason my enemies
> Hunted me down like a bird.
###### 53
> They shut me up in a pit
> And threw stones at me.
###### 54
> The waters closed over my head;
> I thought I was about to die.
###### 55
> I have called on your name, O LORD,
> From the deepest pit.
###### 56
> You heard my plea:
> “Do not close your ears to my cry for relief!”
###### 57
> You came near on the day I called to you;
> You said, “Do not fear!”
###### 58
> O Lord, you championed my cause;
> You redeemed my life.
###### 59
> You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD;
> Pronounce judgment on my behalf!
###### 60
> You have seen all their vengeance,
> All their plots against me.
###### 61
> You have heard their taunts, O LORD,
> All their plots against me.
###### 62
> My assailants revile and conspire
> Against me all day long.
###### 63
> Watch them from morning to evening;
> I am the object of their mocking songs.
###### 64
> Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD,
> According to what they have done.
###### 65
> Give them a distraught heart;
> May your curse be on them!
###### 66
> Pursue them in anger and eradicate them
> From under the LORD’s heaven.
