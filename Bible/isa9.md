# Isaiah 9
###### ¶ 1
 The gloom will be dispelled for those who were anxious.
> In earlier times he humiliated
> The land of Zebulun,
> And the land of Naphtali;
> But now he brings honor
> To the way of the sea,
> The region beyond the Jordan,
> And Galilee of the nations.
###### 2
>  The people walking in darkness
> See a bright light;
> Light shines
> On those who live in a land of deep darkness.
###### 3
> You have enlarged the nation;
> You give them great joy.
> They rejoice in your presence
> As harvesters rejoice;
> As warriors celebrate when they divide up the plunder.
###### 4
> For their oppressive yoke
> And the club that strikes their shoulders,
> The cudgel the oppressor uses on them,
> You have shattered, as in the day of Midian’s defeat.
###### 5
> Indeed every boot that marches and shakes the earth
> And every garment dragged through blood
> Is used as fuel for the fire.
###### 6
> For a child has been born to us,
> A son has been given to us.
> He shoulders responsibility
> And is called
> Wonderful Adviser,
> Mighty God,
> Everlasting Father,
> Prince of Peace.
###### 7
> His dominion will be vast,
> And he will bring immeasurable prosperity.
> He will rule on David’s throne
> And over David’s kingdom,
> Establishing it and strengthening it
> By promoting justice and fairness,
> From this time forward and forevermore.
> The zeal of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
## God’s Judgment Intensifies
###### ¶ 8
> The Lord decreed judgment on Jacob,
> And it fell on Israel.
###### 9
> All the people were aware of it,
> The people of Ephraim and those living in Samaria.
> Yet with pride and an arrogant attitude, they said,
###### 10
>  “ The bricks have fallen,
>  “ But we will rebuild with chiseled stone;
>  “ The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,
>  “ But we will replace them with cedars.”
###### 11
> Then the LORD provoked their adversaries to attack them,
> He stirred up their enemies—
###### 12
> Syria from the east,
> And the Philistines from the west;
> They gobbled up Israelite territory.
> Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
> And his hand is ready to strike again.
###### ¶ 13
> The people did not return to the one who struck them,
> They did not seek reconciliation with the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 14
> So the LORD cut off Israel’s head and tail,
> Both the shoots and stalk in one day.
###### 15
> The leaders and the highly respected people are the head,
> The prophets who teach lies are the tail.
###### 16
> The leaders of this nation were misleading people,
> And the people being led were destroyed.
###### 17
> So the Lord was not pleased with their young men,
> He took no pity on their orphans and widows;
> For the whole nation was godless and did wicked things,
> Every mouth was speaking disgraceful words.
> Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
> And his hand is ready to strike again.
###### ¶ 18
> For evil burned like a fire,
> It consumed thorns and briers;
> It burned up the thickets of the forest,
> And they went up in smoke.
###### 19
> Because of the anger of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the land was scorched,
> And the people became fuel for the fire.
> People had no compassion on one another.
###### 20
> They devoured on the right, but were still hungry;
> They ate on the left, but were not satisfied.
> People even ate the flesh of their own arm!
###### 21
> Manasseh fought against Ephraim,
> And Ephraim against Manasseh;
> Together they fought against Judah.
> Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
> And his hand is ready to strike again.
