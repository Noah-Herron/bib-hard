## The Lord Recalls Israel’s Earlier Faithfulness
###### ¶ 1
The LORD’s message came to me,
###### 2
“Go and declare in the hearing of the people of Jerusalem: ‘This is what the LORD says: “I have fond memories of you, how devoted you were to me in your early years. I remember how you loved me like a new bride; you followed me through the wilderness, through a land that had never been planted.
###### 3
‘Israel was set apart to the Lord; they were like the firstfruits of a harvest to him. All who tried to devour them were punished; disaster came upon them,” says the LORD.’”
## The Lord Reminds Them of the Unfaithfulness of Their Ancestors
###### ¶ 4
> Now listen to the LORD’s message, you descendants of Jacob,
> All you family groups from the nation of Israel.
###### 5
> This is what the LORD says:
>  “ What fault could your ancestors have possibly found in me
>  “ That they strayed so far from me?
>  “ They paid allegiance to worthless idols, and so became worthless to me.
###### 6
>  “ They did not ask,
>  ‘ Where is the LORD who delivered us out of Egypt,
>  ‘ Who brought us through the wilderness,
>  ‘ Through a land of valleys and gorges,
>  ‘ Through a land of desert and deep darkness,
>  ‘ Through a land in which no one travels,
>  ‘ And where no one lives?’
###### 7
>  “ I brought you into a fertile land
>  “ So you could enjoy its fruits and its rich bounty.
>  “ But when you entered my land, you defiled it;
>  “ You made the land I call my own loathsome to me.
###### 8
>  “ Your priests did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD?’
>  “ Those responsible for teaching my law did not really know me.
>  “ Your rulers rebelled against me.
>  “ Your prophets prophesied in the name of the god Baal.
>  “ They all worshiped idols that could not help them.”
## The Lord Charges Contemporary Israel with Spiritual Adultery
###### ¶ 9
>  “ So, once more I will state my case against you,” says the LORD.
>  “ I will also state it against your children and grandchildren.
###### 10
>  “ Go west across the sea to the coasts of Cyprus and see.
>  “ Send someone east to Kedar and have them look carefully.
>  “ See if such a thing as this has ever happened:
###### 11
>  “ Has a nation ever changed its gods
>  “ (even though they are not really gods at all)?
>  “ But my people have exchanged me, their glorious God,
>  “ For a god that cannot help them at all!
###### 12
>  “ Be amazed at this, O heavens.
>  “ Be shocked and utterly dumbfounded,”
> Says the LORD.
###### 13
>  “ Do so because my people have committed a double wrong:
>  “ They have rejected me,
>  “ The fountain of life-giving water,
>  “ And they have dug cisterns for themselves,
>  “ Cracked cisterns that cannot even hold water.”
## Israel’s Reliance on Foreign Alliances (not on God)
###### ¶ 14
>  “ Israel is not a slave, is he?
>  “ He was not born into slavery, was he?
>  “ If not, why then is he being carried off?
###### 15
>  “ Like lions his enemies roar victoriously over him;
>  “ They raise their voices in triumph.
>  “ They have laid his land waste;
>  “ His cities have been burned down and deserted.
###### 16
>  “ Even the soldiers from Memphis and Tahpanhes
>  “ Have cracked your skulls, people of Israel.
###### 17
>  “ You have brought all this on yourself, Israel,
>  “ By deserting the LORD your God when he was leading you along the right path.
###### 18
>  “ What good will it do you then to go down to Egypt
>  “ To seek help from the Egyptians?
>  “ What good will it do you to go over to Assyria
>  “ To seek help from the Assyrians?
###### 19
>  “ Your own wickedness will bring about your punishment.
>  “ Your unfaithful acts will bring down discipline on you.
>  “ Know, then, and realize how utterly harmful
>  “ It was for you to reject me, the LORD your God,
>  “ To show no respect for me,”
> Says the Sovereign LORD of Heaven’s Armies.
## The Lord Expresses His Exasperation at Judah’s Persistent Idolatry
###### ¶ 20
>  “ Indeed, long ago you threw off my authority
>  “ And refused to be subject to me.
>  “ You said, ‘I will not serve you.’
>  “ Instead, you gave yourself to other gods on every high hill
>  “ And under every green tree,
>  “ Like a prostitute sprawls out before her lovers.
###### 21
>  “ I planted you in the land
>  “ Like a special vine of the very best stock.
>  “ Why in the world have you turned into something like a wild vine
>  “ That produces rotten, foul-smelling grapes?
###### 22
>  “ You can try to wash away your guilt with a strong detergent.
>  “ You can use as much soap as you want.
>  “ But the stain of your guilt is still there for me to see,”
> Says the Sovereign LORD.
###### 23
>  “ How can you say, ‘I have not made myself unclean.
>  ‘ I have not paid allegiance to the gods called Baal.’
>  “ Just look at the way you have behaved in the Valley of Hinnom!
>  “ Think about the things you have done there!
>  “ You are like a flighty, young female camel
>  “ That rushes here and there, crisscrossing its path.
###### 24
>  “ You are like a wild female donkey brought up in the wilderness.
>  “ In her lust she sniffs the wind to get the scent of a male.
>  “ No one can hold her back when she is in heat.
>  “ None of the males need wear themselves out chasing after her.
>  “ At mating time she is easy to find.
###### 25
>  “ Do not chase after other gods until your shoes wear out
>  “ And your throats become dry.
>  “ But you say, ‘It is useless for you to try and stop me
>  ‘ Because I love those foreign gods and want to pursue them!’
###### ¶ 26
>  “ Just as a thief has to suffer dishonor when he is caught,
>  “ So the people of Israel will suffer dishonor for what they have done.
>  “ So will their kings and officials,
>  “ Their priests and their prophets.
###### 27
>  “ They say to a wooden idol, ‘You are my father.’
>  “ They say to a stone image, ‘You gave birth to me.’
>  “ Yes, they have turned away from me instead of turning to me.
>  “ Yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’
###### 28
>  “ But where are the gods you made for yourselves?
>  “ Let them save you when you are in trouble.
>  “ The sad fact is that you have as many gods
>  “ As you have towns, Judah.
###### ¶ 29
>  “ Why do you try to refute me?
>  “ All of you have rebelled against me,”
> Says the LORD.
###### 30
>  “ It did no good for me to punish your people.
>  “ They did not respond to such correction.
>  “ You slaughtered your prophets
>  “ Like a voracious lion.
###### 31
>  “ You people of this generation,
>  “ Listen to the LORD’s message:
>  “ Have I been like a wilderness to you, Israel?
>  “ Have I been like a dark and dangerous land to you?
>  “ Why then do you say, ‘We are free to wander.
>  ‘ We will not come to you anymore?’
###### 32
>  “ Does a young woman forget to put on her jewels?
>  “ Does a bride forget to put on her bridal attire?
>  “ But my people have forgotten me
>  “ For more days than can even be counted.
###### 33
>  “ My, how good you have become
>  “ At chasing after your lovers!
>  “ Why, you could even teach prostitutes a thing or two!
###### 34
>  “ Even your clothes are stained with
>  “ The lifeblood of the poor who had not done anything wrong;
>  “ You did not catch them breaking into your homes.
>  “ Yet, in spite of all these things you have done,
###### 35
>  “ You say, ‘I have not done anything wrong,
>  ‘ So the LORD cannot really be angry with me any more.’
>  “ But, watch out! I will bring down judgment on you
>  “ Because you say, ‘I have not committed any sin.’
###### 36
>  “ Why do you constantly go about
>  “ Changing your political allegiances?
>  “ You will get no help from Egypt
>  “ Just as you got no help from Assyria.
###### 37
>  “ Moreover, you will come away from Egypt
>  “ With your hands covering your faces in sorrow and shame
>  “ Because the LORD will not allow your reliance on them to be successful
>  “ And you will not gain any help from them.
