# Ecclesiastes 8
## Human Government Demonstrates Limitations of Wisdom
###### ¶ 1
> Who is a wise person? Who knows the solution to a problem?
> A person’s wisdom brightens his appearance, and softens his harsh countenance.
###### ¶ 2
> Obey the king’s command,
> Because you took an oath before God to be loyal to him.
###### 3
> Do not rush out of the king’s presence in haste—do not delay when the matter is unpleasant,
> For he can do whatever he pleases.
###### 4
> Surely the king’s authority is absolute;
> No one can say to him, “What are you doing?”
###### ¶ 5
> Whoever obeys his command will not experience harm,
> And a wise person knows the proper time and procedure.
###### 6
> For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,
> For the oppression of the king is severe upon his victim.
###### 7
> Surely no one knows the future,
> And no one can tell another person what will happen.
###### 8
> Just as no one has power over the wind to restrain it,
> So no one has power over the day of his death.
> Just as no one can be discharged during the battle,
> So wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.
###### 9
> While applying my mind to everything that happens in this world, I have seen all this:
> Sometimes one person dominates other people to their harm.
## Contradictions to the Law of Retribution
###### ¶ 10
> Not only that, but I have seen the wicked approaching and entering the temple,
> And as they left the holy temple, they
> Boasted in the city that they had done so.
> This also is an enigma.
###### 11
> When a sentence is not executed at once against a crime,
> The human heart is encouraged to do evil.
###### 12
> Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes and still live a long time,
> Yet I know that it will go well with God-fearing people—for they stand in fear before him.
###### 13
> But it will not go well with the wicked,
> Nor will they prolong their days like a shadow,
> Because they do not stand in fear before God.
###### ¶ 14
> Here is another enigma that occurs on earth:
> Sometimes there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve,
> And sometimes there are wicked people who get what the righteous deserve.
> I said, “This also is an enigma.”
## Enjoy Life In Spite of Its Injustices
###### 15
> So I recommend the enjoyment of life,
> For there is nothing better on earth for a person to do except to eat, drink, and enjoy life.
> So joy will accompany him in his toil
> During the days of his life that God gives him on earth.
## Limitations of Human Wisdom
###### ¶ 16
> When I tried to gain wisdom
> And to observe the activity on earth—
> Even though it prevents anyone from sleeping day or night—
###### 17
> Then I discerned all that God has done:
> No one really comprehends what happens on earth.
> Despite all human efforts to discover it, no one can ever grasp it.
> Even if a wise person claimed that he understood,
> He would not really comprehend it.
