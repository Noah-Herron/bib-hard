# Proverbs 29
###### ¶ 1
> The one who stiffens his neck after numerous rebukes
> Will suddenly be destroyed without remedy.
###### 2
> When the righteous become numerous, the people rejoice;
> When the wicked rule, the people groan.
###### 3
> The man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
> But whoever associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth.
###### 4
> A king brings stability to a land by justice,
> But one who exacts tribute tears it down.
###### 5
> The one who flatters his neighbor
> Spreads a net for his steps.
###### 6
> In the transgression of an evil person there is a snare,
> But a righteous person can sing and rejoice.
###### 7
> The righteous person cares for the legal rights of the poor;
> The wicked person does not understand such knowledge.
###### 8
> Scornful people inflame a city,
> But those who are wise turn away wrath.
###### 9
> When a wise person goes to court with a foolish person,
> There is no peace whether he is angry or laughs.
###### 10

> The LORD gives light to the eyes of them both.
###### 14
> If a king judges the poor in truth,
> His throne will be established forever.
###### 15
> A rod and reproof impart wisdom,
> But a child who is unrestrained brings shame to his mother.
###### 16
> When the wicked increase, transgression increases,
> But the righteous will see their downfall.
###### 17
> Discipline your child, and he will give you rest;
> He will bring you happiness.
###### 18
> When there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint,
> But the one who keeps the law, blessed is he!
###### 19
> A servant cannot be corrected by words,
> For although he understands, there is no answer.
###### 20
> You have seen someone who is hasty in his words—
> There is more hope for a fool than for him.
###### 21
> If someone pampers his servant from youth,
> He will be a weakling in the end.
###### 22
> An angry person stirs up dissension,
> And a wrathful person is abounding in transgression.
###### 23
> A person’s pride will bring him low,
> But one who has a lowly spirit will gain honor.
###### 24
> Whoever shares with a thief is his own enemy;
> He hears the oath to testify, but does not talk.
###### 25
> The fear of people becomes a snare,
> But whoever trusts in the LORD will be set on high.
###### 26
> Many people seek the face of a ruler,
> But it is from the LORD that one receives justice.
###### 27
> An unjust person is an abomination to the righteous,
> And the one who lives an upright life is an abomination to the wicked.
