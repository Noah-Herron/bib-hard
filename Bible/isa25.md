# Isaiah 25
###### ¶ 1
> O LORD, you are my God!
> I will exalt you in praise, I will extol your fame.
> For you have done extraordinary things,
> And executed plans made long ago exactly as you decreed.
###### 2
> Indeed, you have made the city into a heap of rubble,
> The fortified town into a heap of ruins;
> The fortress of foreigners is no longer a city,
> It will never be rebuilt.
###### 3
> So a strong nation will extol you;
> The towns of powerful nations will fear you.
###### 4
> For you are a protector for the poor,
> A protector for the needy in their distress,
> A shelter from the rainstorm,
> A shade from the heat.
> Though the breath of tyrants is like a winter rainstorm,
###### 5
> Like heat in a dry land,
> You humble the boasting foreigners.
> Just as the shadow of a cloud causes the heat to subside,
> So he causes the song of tyrants to cease.
###### ¶ 6
> The LORD of Heaven’s Armies will hold a banquet for all the nations on this mountain.
> At this banquet there will be plenty of meat and aged wine—
> Tender meat and choicest wine.
###### 7
> On this mountain he will swallow up
> The shroud that is over all the peoples,
> The woven covering that is over all the nations;
###### 8
> He will swallow up death permanently.
> The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from every face,
> And remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth.
> Indeed, the LORD has announced it!
###### 9
> At that time they will say,
>  “ Look, here is our God!
>  “ We waited for him, and he delivered us.
>  “ Here is the LORD! We waited for him.
>  “ Let’s rejoice and celebrate his deliverance!”
###### 10
> For the LORD’s power will make this mountain secure.
> Moab will be trampled down where it stands,
> As a heap of straw is trampled down in a manure pile.
###### 11
> Moab will spread out its hands in the middle of it,
> Just as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim;
> The LORD will bring down Moab’s pride as it spreads its hands.
###### 12
> The fortified city (along with the very tops of your walls) he will knock down,
> He will bring it down, he will throw it down to the dusty ground.
