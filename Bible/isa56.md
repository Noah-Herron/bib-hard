# Isaiah 56
## The Lord Invites Outsiders to Enter
###### ¶ 1
> This is what the LORD says,
> “Promote justice! Do what is right!
> “For I am ready to deliver you;
> “I am ready to vindicate you openly.
###### 2
> “The people who do this will be blessed,
> “The people who commit themselves to obedience,
> “Who observe the Sabbath and do not defile it,
> “Who refrain from doing anything that is wrong.
###### 3
> “No foreigner who becomes a follower of the LORD should say,
> ‘The LORD will certainly exclude me from his people.’
> “The eunuch should not say,
> ‘Look, I am like a dried-up tree.’”
###### 4
For this is what the LORD says:
> “For the eunuchs who observe my Sabbaths
> “And choose what pleases me
> “And are faithful to my covenant,
###### 5
> “I will set up within my temple and my walls a monument
> “That will be better than sons and daughters.
> “I will set up a permanent monument for them that will remain.
###### ¶ 6
> “As for foreigners who become followers of the LORD and serve him,
> “Who love the name of the LORD and want to be his servants—
> “All who observe the Sabbath and do not defile it,
> “And who are faithful to my covenant—
###### 7
> “I will bring them to my holy mountain;
> “I will make them happy in the temple where people pray to me.
> “Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar,
> “For my temple will be known as a temple where all nations may pray.”
###### 8
> The Sovereign LORD says this,
> The one who gathers the dispersed of Israel:
> “I will still gather them up.”
## The Lord Denounces Israel’s Paganism
###### ¶ 9
> All you wild animals in the fields, come and devour,
> All you wild animals in the forest!
###### 10
> All their watchmen are blind,
> They are unaware.
> All of them are like mute dogs,
> Unable to bark.
> They pant, lie down,
> And love to snooze.
###### 11
> The dogs have big appetites;
> They are never full.
> They are shepherds who have no understanding;
> They all go their own way,
> Each one looking for monetary gain.
###### 12
> Each one says,
> ‘Come on, I’ll get some wine!
> “Let’s guzzle some beer!
> “Tomorrow will be just like today!
> “We’ll have everything we want!’
