# Job 25
## Bildad’s Third Speech
###### ¶ 1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
###### 2
> “Dominion and awesome might belong to God;
> “He establishes peace in his heights.
###### 3
> “Can his armies be numbered?
> “On whom does his light not rise?
###### 4
> “How then can a human being be righteous before God?
> “How can one born of a woman be pure?
###### 5
> “If even the moon is not bright,
> “And the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned,
###### 6
> “How much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot—
> “A son of man, who is only a worm!”
