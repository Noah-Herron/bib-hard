# Psalm 64
###### ¶ 1
> Listen to me, O God, as I offer my lament!
> Protect my life from the enemy’s terrifying attacks.
###### 2
> Hide me from the plots of evil men,
> From the crowd of evildoers.
###### 3
> They sharpen their tongues like swords;
> They aim their arrows, a slanderous charge,
###### 4
> In order to shoot down the innocent in secluded places.
> They shoot at him suddenly and are unafraid of retaliation.
###### 5
> They encourage one another to carry out their evil deed.
> They plan how to hide snares,
> And boast, “Who will see them?”
###### 6
> They devise unjust schemes;
> They disguise a well-conceived plot.
> Man’s inner thoughts cannot be discovered.
###### ¶ 7
> But God will shoot at them;
> Suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow.
###### 8
> Their slander will bring about their demise.
> All who see them will shudder,
###### 9
> And all people will fear.
> They will proclaim what God has done,
> And reflect on his deeds.
###### 10
> The godly will rejoice in the LORD
> And take shelter in him.
> All the morally upright will boast.
