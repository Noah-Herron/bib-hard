# Song of Songs 8
## The Beloved’s Wish Song
###### ¶ 1
> Oh, how I wish you were my little brother,
> Nursing at my mother’s breasts;
> If I saw you outside, I could kiss you—
> Surely no one would despise me!
###### 2
> I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house,
> The one who taught me.
> I would give you spiced wine to drink,
> The nectar of my pomegranates.
## Double Refrain: Embracing and Adjuration
###### 3
> His left hand is under my head,
and his right hand embraces me.
###### ¶ 4
> I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem:
>  “ Do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!”
## The Awakening of Love
###### ¶ 5
> Who is this coming up from the wilderness,
leaning on her beloved?
> Under the apple tree I aroused you;
> There your mother conceived you,
> There she who bore you was in labor of childbirth.
## The Nature of True Love
###### 6
> Set me like a cylinder seal over your heart,
> Like a signet on your arm.
> For love is as strong as death,
> Passion is as unrelenting as Sheol.
> Its flames burst forth,
> It is a blazing flame.
###### 7
> Surging waters cannot quench love;
> Floodwaters cannot overflow it.
> If someone were to offer all his possessions to buy love,
> The offer would be utterly despised.
## The Brother’s Plan and the Sister’s Reward
###### ¶ 8
> We have a little sister,
and as yet she has no breasts.
What shall we do for our sister
on the day when she is spoken for?
###### 9
If she is a wall,
we will build on her a battlement of silver;
but if she is a door,
we will barricade her with boards of cedar.
###### ¶ 10
> I was a wall,
> And my breasts were like fortress towers.
> Then I found favor in his eyes.
## Solomon’s Vineyard and the Beloved’s Vineyard

###### 12

> The thousand shekels belong to you, O Solomon,
> And 200 shekels belong to those who maintain it for its fruit.

my companions are listening attentively for your voice;
let me be the one to hear it!
###### ¶ 14

> Be like a gazelle or a young stag
> On the mountains of spices.
