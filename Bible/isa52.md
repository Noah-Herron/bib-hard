# Isaiah 52
###### ¶ 1
> Wake up! Wake up!
> Clothe yourself with strength, O Zion!
> Put on your beautiful clothes,
> O Jerusalem, holy city.
> For uncircumcised and unclean pagans
> Will no longer invade you.
###### 2
> Shake off the dirt!
> Get up, captive Jerusalem.
> Take off the iron chains around your neck,
> O captive daughter Zion.
###### ¶ 3
For this is what the LORD says:
>  “ You were sold for nothing,
>  “ And you will not be redeemed for money.”
###### 4
For this is what the Sovereign LORD says:
>  “ In the beginning my people went to live temporarily in Egypt;
>  “ Assyria oppressed them for no good reason.
###### 5
>  “ And now, what do we have here?” says the LORD.
>  “ Indeed my people have been carried away for nothing,
>  “ Those who rule over them taunt,” says the LORD,
>  “ And my name is constantly slandered all day long.
###### 6
>  “ For this reason my people will know my name;
>  “ For this reason they will know at that time that I am the one who says,
>  ‘ Here I am.’”
###### ¶ 7
> How delightful it is to see approaching over the mountains
> The feet of a messenger who announces peace,
> A messenger who brings good news, who announces deliverance,
> Who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
###### 8
> Listen, your watchmen shout;
> In unison they shout for joy,
> For they see with their very own eyes
> The LORD’s return to Zion.
###### 9
> In unison give a joyful shout,
> O ruins of Jerusalem!
> For the LORD consoles his people;
> He protects Jerusalem.
###### 10
> The LORD reveals his royal power
> In the sight of all the nations;
> The entire earth sees
> Our God deliver.
###### ¶ 11
> Leave! Leave! Get out of there!
> Don’t touch anything unclean!
>  “ Get out of it!
>  “ Stay pure, you who carry the LORD’s holy items.
###### 12
>  “ Yet do not depart quickly
>  “ Or leave in a panic.
>  “ For the LORD goes before you;
>  “ The God of Israel is your rear guard.”
## The Lord Will Vindicate His Servant
###### ¶ 13
>  “ Look, my servant will succeed!
>  “ He will be elevated, lifted high, and greatly exalted—
###### 14
>  “ (just as many were horrified by the sight of you)
>  “ He was so disfigured he no longer looked like a man;
>  “ His form was so marred he no longer looked human—
###### 15
>  “ So now he will startle many nations.
>  “ Kings will be shocked by his exaltation,
>  “ For they will witness something unannounced to them,
>  “ And they will understand something they had not heard about.
