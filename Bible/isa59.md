# Isaiah 59
## Injustice Brings Alienation from God
###### ¶ 1
> Look, the LORD’s hand is not too weak to deliver you;
> His ear is not too deaf to hear you.
###### 2
> But your sinful acts have alienated you from your God;
> Your sins have caused him to reject you and not listen to your prayers.
###### 3
> For your hands are stained with blood
> And your fingers with sin;
> Your lips speak lies,
> Your tongue utters malicious words.
###### 4
> No one is concerned about justice;
> No one sets forth his case truthfully.
> They depend on false words and tell lies;
> They conceive of oppression
> And give birth to sin.
###### 5
> They hatch the eggs of a poisonous snake
> And spin a spider’s web.
> Whoever eats their eggs will die,
> A poisonous snake is hatched.
###### 6
> Their webs cannot be used for clothing;
> They cannot cover themselves with what they make.
> Their deeds are sinful;
> They commit violent crimes.
###### 7
> They are eager to do evil,
> Quick to shed innocent blood.
> Their thoughts are sinful;
> They crush and destroy.
###### 8
> They are unfamiliar with peace;
> Their deeds are unjust.
> They use deceitful methods,
> And whoever deals with them is unfamiliar with peace.
## Israel Confesses its Sin
###### ¶ 9
> For this reason deliverance is far from us
> And salvation does not reach us.
> We wait for light, but see only darkness;
> We wait for a bright light, but live in deep darkness.
###### 10
> We grope along the wall like the blind,
> We grope like those who cannot see;
> We stumble at noontime as if it were evening.
> Though others are strong, we are like dead men.
###### 11
> We all growl like bears,
> We coo mournfully like doves;
> We wait for deliverance, but there is none,
> For salvation, but it is far from us.
###### 12
> For you are aware of our many rebellious deeds,
> And our sins testify against us;
> Indeed, we are aware of our rebellious deeds;
> We know our sins all too well.
###### 13
> We have rebelled and tried to deceive the LORD;
> We turned back from following our God.
> We stir up oppression and rebellion;
> We tell lies we concocted in our minds.
###### 14
> Justice is driven back;
> Godliness stands far off.
> Indeed, honesty stumbles in the city square
> And morality is not even able to enter.
###### 15
> Honesty has disappeared;
> The one who tries to avoid evil is robbed.
> The LORD watches and is displeased,
> For there is no justice.
## The Lord Intervenes
###### 16
> He sees there is no advocate;
> He is shocked that no one intervenes.
> So he takes matters into his own hands;
> His desire for justice drives him on.
###### 17
> He wears his desire for justice like body armor,
> And his desire to deliver is like a helmet on his head.
> He puts on the garments of vengeance
> And wears zeal like a robe.
###### 18
> He repays them for what they have done,
> Dispensing angry judgment to his adversaries
> And punishing his enemies.
> He repays the coastlands.
###### 19
> In the west, people respect the LORD’s reputation;
> In the east they recognize his splendor.
> For he comes like a rushing stream
> Driven on by wind sent from the LORD.
###### 20
>  “ A protector comes to Zion,
>  “ To those in Jacob who repent of their rebellious deeds,” says the LORD.
###### ¶ 21
“As for me, this is my promise to them,” says the LORD. “My Spirit, who is upon you, and my words, which I have placed in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children and descendants from this time forward,” says the LORD.
