# Psalm 60
###### ¶ 1
> O God, you have rejected us.
> You suddenly turned on us in your anger.
> Please restore us!
###### 2
> You made the earth quake; you split it open.
> Repair its breaches, for it is ready to fall.
###### 3
> You have made your people experience hard times;
> You have made us drink intoxicating wine.
###### 4
> You have given your loyal followers a rallying flag,
> So that they might seek safety from the bow. (Selah)
###### 5
> Deliver by your power and answer me,
> So that the ones you love may be safe.
###### ¶ 6
> God has spoken in his sanctuary:
>  “ I will triumph. I will parcel out Shechem;
>  “ The Valley of Sukkoth I will measure off.
###### 7
>  “ Gilead belongs to me,
>  “ As does Manasseh.
>  “ Ephraim is my helmet,
>  “ Judah my royal scepter.
###### 8
>  “ Moab is my washbasin.
>  “ I will make Edom serve me.
>  “ I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”
###### ¶ 9
> Who will lead me into the fortified city?
> Who will bring me to Edom?
###### 10
> Have you not rejected us, O God?
> O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.
###### 11
> Give us help against the enemy,
> For any help men might offer is futile.
###### 12
> By God’s power we will conquer;
> He will trample down our enemies.
