# Proverbs 31
## The Words of Lemuel
###### ¶ 1
The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him:
###### ¶ 2
> O my son, O son of my womb,
> O son of my vows,
###### 3
> Do not give your strength to women,
> Nor your ways to that which ruins kings.
###### 4
> It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
> It is not for kings to drink wine,
> Or for rulers to crave strong drink,
###### 5
> Lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
> And remove from all the poor their legal rights.
###### 6
> Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
> And wine to those who are bitterly distressed;
###### 7
> Let them drink and forget their poverty,
> And remember their misery no more.
###### 8
> Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,
> For the legal rights of all the dying.
###### 9
> Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,
> And plead the cause of the poor and needy.
## The Wife of Noble Character
###### ¶ 10
> Who can find a wife of noble character?
> For her value is far more than rubies.
###### 11
> Her husband’s heart has trusted her,
> And he does not lack the dividends.
###### 12
> She has rewarded him with good and not harm
> All the days of her life.
###### 13
> She sought out wool and flax,
> Then worked happily with her hands.
###### 14
> She was like the merchant ships;
> She would bring in her food from afar.
###### 15
> Then she rose while it was still night,
> And provided food for her household and a portion to her female servants.
###### 16
> She considered a field and bought it;
> From her own income she planted a vineyard.
###### 17
> She clothed herself in might,
> And she strengthened her arms.
###### 18
> She perceived that her merchandise was good.
> Her lamp would not go out in the night.
###### 19
> She extended her hands to the spool,
> And her hands grasped the spindle.
###### 20
> She opened her hand to the poor,
> And extended her hands to the needy.
###### 21
> She would not fear for her household in winter,
> Because all her household were clothed with scarlet,
###### 22
> Because she had made coverings for herself;
> And because her clothing was fine linen and purple.
###### 23
> Her husband is well-known in the city gate
> When he sits with the elders of the land.
###### 24
> She made linen garments then sold them,
> And traded belts to the merchants;
###### 25
> Her clothing was strong and splendid;
> And she laughed at the time to come.
###### 26
> She has opened her mouth with wisdom,
> With loving instruction on her tongue.
###### 27
> Watching over the ways of her household,
> She would not eat the bread of idleness.
###### 28
> Her children have risen and called her blessed;
> Her husband also has praised her:
###### 29
>  “ Many daughters have done valiantly,
>  “ But you have surpassed them all!”
###### 30
> Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting.
> A woman who fears the LORD—she makes herself praiseworthy.
###### 31
> Give her credit for what she has accomplished,
> And let her works praise her in the city gates.
