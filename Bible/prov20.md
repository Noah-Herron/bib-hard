# Proverbs 20
###### ¶ 1
> Wine is a mocker and strong drink is a brawler;
> Whoever goes astray by them is not wise.
###### 2
> The king’s terrifying anger is like the roar of a lion;
> Whoever provokes him sins against himself.
###### 3
> It is an honor for a person to cease from strife,
> But every fool quarrels.
###### 4
> The sluggard will not plow during the planting season,
> So at harvest time he asks for grain but has nothing.
###### 5
> Counsel in a person’s heart is like deep water,
> But an understanding person draws it out.
###### 6
> Many people profess their loyalty,
> But a faithful person—who can find?
###### 7
> The righteous person behaves in integrity;
> Blessed are his children after him.
###### 8
> A king sitting on the throne to judge
> Separates out all evil with his eyes.
###### 9
> Who can say, “I have kept my heart clean;
> “I am pure from my sin”?
###### 10
> Diverse weights and diverse measures—
> The LORD abhors both of them.
###### 11
> Even a young man is known by his actions,
> Whether his activity is pure and whether it is right.
###### 12
> The ear that hears and the eye that sees—
> The LORD has made them both.
###### 13
> Do not love sleep, lest you become impoverished;
> Open your eyes so that you might be satisfied with food.
###### 14
> “It’s worthless! It’s worthless!” says the buyer,
> But when he goes on his way, he boasts.
###### 15
> There is gold, and an abundance of rubies,
> But words of knowledge are like a precious jewel.
###### 16
> Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,
> And hold him in pledge on behalf of strangers.
###### 17
> Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet to a person,
> But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.
###### 18
> Plans are established by counsel,
> So make war with guidance.
###### 19
> The one who goes about gossiping reveals secrets;
> Therefore do not associate with someone who is always opening his mouth.
###### 20
> The one who curses his father and his mother,
> His lamp will be extinguished in the blackest darkness.
###### 21
> An inheritance gained easily in the beginning
> Will not be blessed in the end.
###### 22
> Do not say, “I will pay back evil!”
> Wait for the LORD, so that he may vindicate you.
###### 23
> The LORD abhors differing weights,
> And dishonest scales are wicked.
###### 24
> The steps of a person are ordained by the LORD—
> So how can anyone understand his own way?
###### 25
> It is a snare for a person to rashly cry, “Holy!”
> And only afterward to consider what he has vowed.
###### 26
> A wise king separates out the wicked;
> He turns the threshing wheel over them.
###### 27
> The human spirit is like the lamp of the LORD,
> Searching all his innermost parts.
###### 28
> Loyal love and truth preserve a king,
> And his throne is upheld by loyal love.
###### 29
> The glory of young men is their strength,
> And the splendor of old men is gray hair.
###### 30
> Beatings and wounds cleanse away evil,
> And floggings cleanse the innermost being.
