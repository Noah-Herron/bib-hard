# Job 15
## Eliphaz’s Second Speech
###### ¶ 1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
###### 2
>  “ Does a wise man answer with blustery knowledge,
>  “ Or fill his belly with the east wind?
###### 3
>  “ Does he argue with useless talk,
>  “ With words that have no value in them?
###### 4
>  “ But you even break off piety,
>  “ And hinder meditation before God.
###### 5
>  “ Your sin inspires your mouth;
>  “ You choose the language of the crafty.
###### 6
>  “ Your own mouth condemns you, not I;
>  “ Your own lips testify against you.
###### ¶ 7
>  “ Were you the first man ever born?
>  “ Were you brought forth before the hills?
###### 8
>  “ Do you listen in on God’s secret council?
>  “ Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
###### 9
>  “ What do you know that we don’t know?
>  “ What do you understand that we don’t understand?
###### 10
>  “ The gray-haired and the aged are on our side,
>  “ Men far older than your father.
###### 11
>  “ Are God’s consolations too trivial for you,
>  “ Or a word spoken in gentleness to you?
###### 12
>  “ Why has your heart carried you away,
>  “ And why do your eyes flash,
###### 13
>  “ When you turn your rage against God
>  “ And allow such words to escape from your mouth?
###### 14
>  “ What is man that he should be pure,
>  “ Or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
###### 15
>  “ If God places no trust in his holy ones,
>  “ If even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
###### 16
>  “ How much less man, who is abominable and corrupt,
>  “ Who drinks in evil like water!
###### ¶ 17
>  “ I will explain to you;
>  “ Listen to me,
>  “ And what I have seen, I will declare,
###### 18
>  “ What wise men declare,
>  “ Hiding nothing,
>  “ From the tradition of their ancestors,
###### 19
>  “ To whom alone the land was given
>  “ When no foreigner passed among them.
###### 20
>  “ All his days the wicked man suffers torment,
>  “ Throughout the number of the years
>  “ That are stored up for the tyrant.
###### 21
>  “ Terrifying sounds fill his ears;
>  “ In a time of peace marauders attack him.
###### 22
>  “ He does not expect to escape from darkness;
>  “ He is marked for the sword;
###### 23
>  “ He wanders about—food for vultures—
>  “ He knows that the day of darkness is at hand.
###### 24
>  “ Distress and anguish terrify him;
>  “ They prevail against him
>  “ Like a king ready to launch an attack,
###### 25
>  “ For he stretches out his hand against God,
>  “ And vaunts himself against the Almighty,
###### 26
>  “ Defiantly charging against him
>  “ With a thick, strong shield!
###### 27
>  “ Because he covered his face with fat,
>  “ And made his hips bulge with fat,
###### 28
>  “ He lived in ruined towns
>  “ And in houses where no one lives,
>  “ Where they are ready to crumble into heaps.
###### 29
>  “ He will not grow rich,
>  “ And his wealth will not endure,
>  “ Nor will his possessions spread over the land.
###### 30
>  “ He will not escape the darkness;
>  “ A flame will wither his shoots
>  “ And he will depart
>  “ By the breath of God’s mouth.
###### 31
>  “ Let him not trust in what is worthless,
>  “ Deceiving himself;
>  “ For worthlessness will be his reward.
###### 32
>  “ Before his time he will be paid in full,
>  “ And his branches will not flourish.
###### 33
>  “ Like a vine he will let his sour grapes fall,
>  “ And like an olive tree
>  “ He will shed his blossoms.
###### 34
>  “ For the company of the godless is barren,
>  “ And fire consumes the tents of those who accept bribes.
###### 35
>  “ They conceive trouble and bring forth evil;
>  “ Their belly prepares deception.”
