## Judgment Against Moab
###### ¶ 1
The LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, spoke about Moab:
> “Sure to be judged is Nebo! Indeed, it will be destroyed.
> “Kiriathaim will suffer disgrace. It will be captured!
> “Its fortress will suffer disgrace. It will be torn down!
###### 2
> “People will not praise Moab anymore.
> “The enemy will capture Heshbon and plot how to destroy Moab,
> “Saying, ‘Come, let’s put an end to that nation!’
> “City of Madmen, you will also be destroyed.
> “A destructive army will march against you.
###### 3
> “Cries of anguish will arise in Horonaim,
> ‘Oh, the ruin and great destruction!’
###### 4
> “Moab will be crushed.
> “Her children will cry out in distress.
###### 5
> “Indeed they will climb the slopes of Luhith,
> “Weeping continually as they go.
> “For on the road down to Horonaim
> “They will hear the cries of distress over the destruction.
###### 6
> “They will hear, ‘Run! Save yourselves;
> ‘Even if you must be like a lonely shrub in the wilderness!’
###### 7
> “Moab, you trust in the things you do and in your riches.
> “So you too will be conquered.
> “Your god Chemosh will go into exile
> “Along with his priests and his officials.
###### 8
> “The destroyer will come against every town.
> “Not one town will escape.
> “The towns in the valley will be destroyed.
> “The cities on the high plain will be laid waste.
> “I, the LORD, have spoken.
###### 9
> “Set up a gravestone for Moab,
> “For it will certainly be laid in ruins!
> “Its cities will be laid waste
> “And become uninhabited.
###### 10
> “A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the LORD’s work!
> “A curse on anyone who keeps from carrying out his destruction!
###### ¶ 11
> “From its earliest days Moab has lived undisturbed.
> “It has never been taken into exile.
> “Its people are like wine allowed to settle undisturbed on its dregs,
> “Never poured out from one jar to another.
> “They are like wine that tastes like it always did,
> “Whose aroma has remained unchanged.
###### 12
> “But the time is coming when I will send
> “Men against Moab who will empty it out.
> “They will empty the towns of their people,
> “Then will lay those towns in ruins.
> “I, the LORD, affirm it!
###### 13
> “The people of Moab will be disappointed by their god Chemosh.
> “They will be as disappointed as the people of Israel were
> “When they put their trust in the calf god at Bethel.
###### 14
> “How can you men of Moab say, ‘We are heroes,
> ‘Men who are mighty in battle?’
###### 15
> “Moab will be destroyed. Its towns will be invaded.
> “Its finest young men will be slaughtered.
> “I, the King, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, affirm it!
###### 16
> “Moab’s destruction is at hand.
> “Disaster will come on it quickly.
###### 17
> “Mourn for that nation, all you nations living around it,
> “All you nations that know of its fame.
> “Mourn and say, ‘Alas, its powerful influence has been broken!
> ‘Its glory and power have been done away with!’
###### 18
> “Come down from your place of honor;
> “Sit on the dry ground, you who live in Dibon.
> “For the one who will destroy Moab will attack you;
> “He will destroy your fortifications.
###### 19
> “You who live in Aroer,
> “Stand by the road and watch.
> “Question the man who is fleeing and the woman who is escaping.
> “Ask them, ‘What has happened?’
###### 20
> “They will answer, ‘Moab is disgraced, for it has fallen!
> ‘Wail and cry out in mourning!
> ‘Announce along the Arnon River
> ‘That Moab has been destroyed.’
###### ¶ 21
“Judgment will come on the cities on the high plain: on Holon, Jahzah, and Mephaath;
###### 22
“on Dibon, Nebo, and Beth Diblathaim;
###### 23
“on Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul, and Beth Meon;
###### 24
“on Kerioth and Bozrah. It will come on all the towns of Moab, both far and near.
###### 25
“Moab’s might will be crushed. Its power will be broken. I, the LORD, affirm it!
###### 26
> “Moab has vaunted itself against me.
> “So make him drunk with the wine of my wrath
> “Until he splashes around in his own vomit,
> “Until others treat him as a laughingstock.
###### 27
> “For did not you people of Moab laugh at the people of Israel?
> “Did you think that they were nothing but thieves,
> “That you shook your head in contempt
> “Every time you talked about them?
###### 28
> “Leave your towns, you inhabitants of Moab.
> “Go and live in the cliffs.
> “Be like a dove that makes its nest
> “High on the sides of a ravine.
###### 29
> “I have heard how proud the people of Moab are,
> “I know how haughty they are.
> “I have heard how arrogant, proud, and haughty they are,
> “What a high opinion they have of themselves.
###### 30
> “I, the LORD, affirm that I know how arrogant they are.
> “But their pride is ill founded.
> “Their boastings will prove to be false.
###### 31
> “So I will weep with sorrow for Moab.
> “I will cry out in sadness for all Moab.
> “I will moan for the people of Kir Heres.
###### 32
> “I will weep for the grapevines of Sibmah
> “Just like the town of Jazer weeps over them.
> “Their branches once spread as far as the Dead Sea.
> “They reached as far as the town of Jazer.
> “The destroyer will ravage
> “Her fig, date, and grape crops.
###### 33
> “Joy and gladness will disappear
> “From the fruitful land of Moab.
> “I will stop the flow of wine from the winepresses.
> “No one will stomp on the grapes there and shout for joy.
> “The shouts there will be shouts of soldiers,
> “Not the shouts of those making wine.
###### 34
> “Cries of anguish raised from Heshbon and Elealeh
> “Will be sounded as far as Jahaz.
> “They will be sounded from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah.
> “For even the waters of Nimrim will be dried up.
###### 35
> “I will put an end in Moab
> “To those who make offerings at her places of worship.
> “I will put an end to those who sacrifice to other gods.
> “I, the LORD, affirm it!
###### ¶ 36
> “So my heart moans for Moab
> “Like a flute playing a funeral song.
> “Yes, like a flute playing a funeral song,
> “My heart moans for the people of Kir Heres.
> “For the wealth they have gained will perish.
###### 37
> “For all of them will shave their heads in mourning.
> “They will all cut off their beards to show their sorrow.
> “They will all make gashes in their hands.
> “They will all put on sackcloth.
###### 38
> “On all the housetops in Moab
> “And in all its public squares
> “There will be nothing but mourning.
> “For I will break Moab like an unwanted jar.
> “I, the LORD, affirm it!
###### 39
> “Oh, how shattered Moab will be!
> “Oh, how her people will wail!
> “Oh, how she will turn away in shame!
> “Moab will become an object of ridicule,
> “A terrifying sight to all the nations that surround her.”
###### ¶ 40
> For the LORD says,
> “Look! Like an eagle with outspread wings
> “A nation will swoop down on Moab.
###### 41
> “Her towns will be captured;
> “Her fortresses will be taken.
> “At that time the soldiers of Moab will be frightened
> “Like a woman in labor.
###### 42
> “Moab will be destroyed and no longer be a nation,
> “Because she has vaunted herself against the LORD.
###### 43
> “Terror, pits, and traps are in store
> “For the people who live in Moab.
> “I, the LORD, affirm it!
###### 44
> “Anyone who flees at the sound of terror
> “Will fall into a pit.
> “Anyone who climbs out of the pit
> “Will be caught in a trap.
> “For the time is coming
> “When I will punish the people of Moab.
> “I, the LORD, affirm it!
###### ¶ 45
> “In the shadows of the walls of Heshbon
> “Those trying to escape will stand helpless.
> “For a fire will burst forth from Heshbon.
> “Flames will shoot out from the former territory of Sihon.
> “They will burn the foreheads of the people of Moab,
> “The skulls of those war-loving people.
###### 46
> “Moab, you are doomed!
> “You people who worship Chemosh will be destroyed.
> “Your sons will be taken away captive.
> “Your daughters will be carried away into exile.
###### 47
> “Yet in future days
> “I will reverse Moab’s ill fortune,”
> Says the LORD.
The judgment against Moab ends here.
