# Isaiah 50
###### ¶ 1
> This is what the LORD says:
>  “ Where is your mother’s divorce certificate
>  “ By which I divorced her?
>  “ Or to which of my creditors did I sell you?
>  “ Look, you were sold because of your sins;
>  “ Because of your rebellious acts I divorced your mother.
###### 2
>  “ Why does no one challenge me when I come?
>  “ Why does no one respond when I call?
>  “ Is my hand too weak to deliver you?
>  “ Do I lack the power to rescue you?
>  “ Look, with a mere shout I can dry up the sea;
>  “ I can turn streams into a desert,
>  “ So the fish rot away and die
>  “ From lack of water.
###### 3
>  “ I can clothe the sky in darkness;
>  “ I can cover it with sackcloth.”
## The Servant Perseveres
###### ¶ 4
> The Sovereign LORD has given me the capacity to be his spokesman,
> So that I know how to help the weary.
> He wakes me up every morning;
> He makes me alert so I can listen attentively as disciples do.
###### 5
> The Sovereign LORD has spoken to me clearly;
> I have not rebelled,
> I have not turned back.
###### 6
> I offered my back to those who attacked,
> My jaws to those who tore out my beard;
> I did not hide my face
> From insults and spitting.
###### 7
> But the Sovereign LORD helps me,
> So I am not humiliated.
> For that reason I am steadfastly resolved;
> I know I will not be put to shame.
###### 8
> The one who vindicates me is close by.
> Who dares to argue with me? Let us confront each other!
> Who is my accuser? Let him challenge me!
###### 9
> Look, the Sovereign LORD helps me.
> Who dares to condemn me?
> Look, all of them will wear out like clothes;
> A moth will eat away at them.
###### 10
> Who among you fears the LORD?
> Who obeys his servant?
> Whoever walks in deep darkness,
> Without light,
> Should trust in the name of the LORD
> And rely on his God.
###### 11
> Look, all of you who start a fire
> And who equip yourselves with flaming arrows,
> Walk in the light of the fire you started
> And among the flaming arrows you ignited!
> This is what you will receive from me:
> You will lie down in a place of pain.
