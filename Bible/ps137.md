# Psalm 137
###### ¶ 1
> By the rivers of Babylon
> We sit down and weep
> When we remember Zion.
###### 2
> On the poplars in her midst
> We hang our harps,
###### 3
> For there our captors ask us to compose songs;
> Those who mock us demand that we be happy, saying:
> “Sing for us a song about Zion!”
###### ¶ 4
> How can we sing a song to the LORD
> In a foreign land?
###### 5
> If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
> May my right hand be crippled.
###### 6
> May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
> If I do not remember you,
> And do not give Jerusalem priority
> Over whatever gives me the most joy.
###### ¶ 7
> Remember, O LORD, what the Edomites did
> On the day Jerusalem fell.
> They said, “Tear it down, tear it down,
> “Right to its very foundation!”
###### 8
> O daughter Babylon, soon to be devastated,
> How blessed will be the one who repays you
> For what you dished out to us.
###### 9
> How blessed will be the one who grabs your babies
> And smashes them on a rock.
