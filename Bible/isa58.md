# Isaiah 58
## The Lord Desires Genuine Devotion
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Shout loudly! Don’t be quiet!
>  “ Yell as loudly as a trumpet!
>  “ Confront my people with their rebellious deeds;
>  “ Confront Jacob’s family with their sin.
###### 2
>  “ They seek me day after day;
>  “ They want to know my requirements,
>  “ Like a nation that does what is right
>  “ And does not reject the law of their God.
>  “ They ask me for just decrees;
>  “ They want to be near God.
###### 3
>  “ They lament, ‘Why don’t you notice when we fast?
>  “ Why don’t you pay attention when we humble ourselves?’
>  “ Look, at the same time you fast, you satisfy your selfish desires,
>  “ You oppress your workers.
###### 4
>  “ Look, your fasting is accompanied by arguments, brawls,
>  “ And fistfights.
>  “ Do not fast as you do today,
>  “ Trying to make your voice heard in heaven.
###### 5
>  “ Is this really the kind of fasting I want?
>  “ Do I want a day when people merely humble themselves,
>  “ Bowing their heads like a reed
>  “ And stretching out on sackcloth and ashes?
>  “ Is this really what you call a fast,
>  “ A day that is pleasing to the LORD?
###### 6
>  “ No, this is the kind of fast I want:
>  “ I want you to remove the sinful chains,
>  “ To tear away the ropes of the burdensome yoke,
>  “ To set free the oppressed,
>  “ And to break every burdensome yoke.
###### 7
>  “ I want you to share your food with the hungry
>  “ And to provide shelter for homeless, oppressed people.
>  “ When you see someone naked, clothe them!
>  “ Don’t turn your back on your own flesh and blood.
###### 8
>  “ Then your light will shine like the sunrise;
>  “ Your restoration will quickly arrive;
>  “ Your godly behavior will go before you,
>  “ And the LORD’s splendor will be your rear guard.
###### 9
>  “ Then you will call out, and the LORD will respond;
>  “ You will cry out, and he will reply, ‘Here I am.’
>  “ You must remove the burdensome yoke from among you
>  “ And stop pointing fingers and speaking sinfully.
###### 10
>  “ You must actively help the hungry
>  “ And feed the oppressed.
>  “ Then your light will dispel the darkness,
>  “ And your darkness will be transformed into noonday.
###### 11
>  “ The LORD will continually lead you;
>  “ He will feed you even in parched regions.
>  “ He will give you renewed strength,
>  “ And you will be like a well-watered garden,
>  “ Like a spring that continually produces water.
###### 12
>  “ Your perpetual ruins will be rebuilt;
>  “ You will reestablish the ancient foundations.
>  “ You will be called, ‘The one who repairs broken walls,
>  ‘ The one who makes the streets inhabitable again.’
###### ¶ 13
>  “ You must observe the Sabbath
>  “ Rather than doing anything you please on my holy day.
>  “ You must look forward to the Sabbath
>  “ And treat the LORD’s holy day with respect.
>  “ You must treat it with respect by refraining from your normal activities,
>  “ And by refraining from your selfish pursuits and from making business deals.
###### 14
>  “ Then you will find joy in your relationship to the LORD,
>  “ And I will give you great prosperity,
>  “ And cause crops to grow on the land I gave to your ancestor Jacob.”
> Know for certain that the LORD has spoken.
