# Micah 5
###### ¶ 1
>  But now slash yourself, daughter surrounded by soldiers!
> We are besieged!
> With a scepter they strike Israel’s ruler
> On the side of his face.
## A King Will Come and a Remnant Will Prosper
###### 2
>  As for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
> Seemingly insignificant among the clans of Judah—
> From you a king will emerge who will rule over Israel on my behalf,
> One whose origins are in the distant past.
###### 3
> So the LORD will hand the people of Israel over to their enemies
> Until the time when the woman in labor gives birth.
> Then the rest of the king’s countrymen will return
> To be reunited with the people of Israel.
###### 4
> He will assume his post and shepherd the people by the LORD’s strength,
> By the sovereign authority of the LORD his God.
> They will live securely, for at that time he will be honored
> Even in the distant regions of the earth.
###### 5
> He will give us peace.
> Should the Assyrians try to invade our land
> And attempt to set foot in our fortresses,
> We will send against them seven shepherd-rulers,
> Make that eight commanders.
###### 6
> They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,
> The land of Nimrod with a drawn sword.
> Our king will rescue us from the Assyrians
> Should they attempt to invade our land
> And try to set foot in our territory.
###### ¶ 7
> Those survivors from Jacob will live
> In the midst of many nations.
> They will be like the dew the LORD sends,
> Like the rain on the grass,
> That does not hope for men to come
> Or wait around for humans to arrive.
###### 8
> Those survivors from Jacob will live among the nations,
> In the midst of many peoples.
> They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest,
> Like a young lion among the flocks of sheep,
> Which attacks when it passes through.
> It rips its prey and there is no one to stop it.
###### 9
> Lift your hand triumphantly against your adversaries;
> May all your enemies be destroyed!
## The Lord Will Purify His People

> “I will destroy your horses from your midst
> “And smash your chariots.
