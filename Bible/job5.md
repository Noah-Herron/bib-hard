# Job 5
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you?
>  “ To which of the holy ones will you turn?
###### 2
>  “ For wrath kills the foolish person,
>  “ And anger slays the silly one.
###### 3
>  “ I myself have seen the fool taking root,
>  “ But suddenly I cursed his place of residence.
###### 4
>  “ His children are far from safety,
>  “ And they are crushed at the place where judgment is rendered,
>  “ Nor is there anyone to deliver them.
###### 5
>  “ The hungry eat up his harvest,
>  “ And take it even from behind the thorns,
>  “ And the thirsty pant for their wealth.
###### 6
>  “ For evil does not come up from the dust,
>  “ Nor does trouble spring up from the ground,
###### 7
>  “ But people are born to trouble,
>  “ As surely as the sparks fly upward.”
## Blessings for the One Who Seeks God
###### ¶ 8
>  “ But as for me, I would seek God,
>  “ And to God I would set forth my case.
###### 9
>  “ He does great and unsearchable things,
>  “ Marvelous things without number;
###### 10
>  “ He gives rain on the earth,
>  “ And sends water on the fields;
###### 11
>  “ He sets the lowly on high,
>  “ That those who mourn are raised to safety.
###### 12
>  “ He frustrates the plans of the crafty
>  “ So that their hands cannot accomplish
>  “ What they had planned.
###### 13

>  “ And the counsel of the cunning is brought to a quick end.
###### 14

>  “ And grope about in the noontime as if it were night.
###### 15
>  “ So he saves from the sword that comes from their mouth,
>  “ Even the poor from the hand of the powerful.
###### 16
>  “ Thus the poor have hope,
>  “ And iniquity shuts its mouth.
###### ¶ 17
>  “ Therefore, blessed is the man whom God corrects,
>  “ So do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
###### 18
>  “ For he wounds, but he also bandages;
>  “ He strikes, but his hands also heal.
###### 19
>  “ He will deliver you from six calamities;
>  “ Yes, in seven no evil will touch you.
###### 20
>  “ In time of famine he will redeem you from death,
>  “ And in time of war from the power of the sword.
###### 21
>  “ You will be protected from malicious gossip,
>  “ And will not be afraid of the destruction when it comes.
###### 22
>  “ You will laugh at destruction and famine
>  “ And need not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
###### 23
>  “ For you will have a pact with the stones of the field,
>  “ And the wild animals will be at peace with you.
###### 24
>  “ And you will know that your home will be secure,
>  “ And when you inspect your domains,
>  “ You will not be missing anything.
###### 25
>  “ You will also know that your children will be numerous,
>  “ And your descendants like the grass of the earth.
###### 26
>  “ You will come to your grave in a full age,
>  “ As stacks of grain are harvested in their season.
###### 27

>  “ Hear it, and apply it for your own good.”
