# Isaiah 31
## Egypt Will Disappoint
###### ¶ 1
> Those who go down to Egypt for help are as good as dead;
> Those who rely on war horses,
> And trust in Egypt’s many chariots
> And in their many, many horsemen.
> But they do not rely on the Holy One of Israel
> And do not seek help from the LORD.
###### 2
> Yet he too is wise and he will bring disaster;
> He does not retract his decree.
> He will attack the wicked nation,
> And the nation that helps those who commit sin.
###### 3
> The Egyptians are mere humans, not God;
> Their horses are made of flesh, not spirit.
> The LORD will strike with his hand;
> The one who helps will stumble
> And the one being helped will fall.
> Together they will perish.
## The Lord Will Defend Zion
###### ¶ 4
> Indeed, this is what the LORD has said to me:
> “The LORD will be like a growling lion,
> “Like a young lion growling over its prey.
> “Though a whole group of shepherds gathers against it,
> “It is not afraid of their shouts
> “Or intimidated by their yelling.
> “In this same way the LORD of Heaven’s Armies will descend
> “To do battle on Mount Zion and on its hill.
###### 5
> “Just as birds hover over a nest,
> “So the LORD of Heaven’s Armies will protect Jerusalem.
> “He will protect and deliver it;
> “As he passes over he will rescue it.”
###### ¶ 6
You Israelites! Return to the one you have so blatantly rebelled against!
###### 7
For at that time every one will get rid of the silver and gold idols your hands sinfully made.
###### 8
> “Assyria will fall by a sword, but not one human-made;
> “A sword not made by humankind will destroy them.
> “They will run away from this sword
> “And their young men will be forced to do hard labor.
###### 9
> “They will surrender their stronghold because of fear;
> “Their officers will be afraid of the LORD’s battle flag.”
> This is what the LORD says—
> The one whose fire is in Zion,
> Whose firepot is in Jerusalem.
