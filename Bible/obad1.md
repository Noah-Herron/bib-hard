###### 2
> The LORD says, “Look! I will make you a weak nation;
> “You will be greatly despised!
###### 3
> “Your presumptuous heart has deceived you—
> “You who reside in the safety of the rocky cliffs,
> “Whose home is high in the mountains.
> “You think to yourself,
> ‘No one can bring me down to the ground!’
###### 4

> “Even if you were to make your nest among the stars,
> “I can bring you down even from there!” says the LORD.
###### 5
> “If thieves came to rob you during the night,
> “They would steal only as much as they wanted.

> “Their hidden valuables will be ransacked!
###### 7
> “All your allies will force you from your homeland!
> “Your treaty partners will deceive you and overpower you.
> “Your trusted friends will set an ambush for you
> “That will take you by surprise!

> “I will destroy the wise sages of Edom,
> “The advisers from Esau’s mountain.

## Edom’s Treachery Against Judah
###### ¶ 10
> “Because you violently slaughtered your relatives, the people of Jacob,
> “Shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.
###### 11

> “And foreigners advanced to his gates.
> “When they cast lots over Jerusalem,
> “You behaved as though you were in league with them.
###### ¶ 12

## The Coming Day of the Lord
###### ¶ 15

> “Just as you have done, so it will be done to you.
> “You will get exactly what your deeds deserve.
###### 16
> “For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,
> “So all the nations will drink continually.
> “They will drink, and they will gulp down;
> “They will be as though they had never been.
###### 17

> “And it will be a holy place once again.
> “The descendants of Jacob will conquer
> “Those who had conquered them.

> Possession of the land of the Philistines.
> They will also take possession of the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,
> And the people of Benjamin will take possession of Gilead.
###### 20
> The exiles of this fortress of the people of Israel
> Will take possession of what belongs to
