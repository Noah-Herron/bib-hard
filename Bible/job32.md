# Job 32
## V. The Speeches of Elihu [32:
## 1-37:
## 24]
## Elihu’s First Speech
###### ¶ 1
So these three men refused to answer Job further, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
###### 2
Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
###### 3
With Job’s three friends he was also angry, because they could not find an answer, and so declared Job guilty.
###### 4
Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than he was.
###### 5
But when Elihu saw that the three men had no further reply, he became very angry.
## Elihu Claims Wisdom
###### ¶ 6
So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up:
>  “ I am young, but you are elderly;
>  “ That is why I was fearful,
>  “ And afraid to explain to you what I know.
###### 7
>  “ I said to myself, ‘Age should speak,
>  ‘ And length of years should make wisdom known.’
###### 8
>  “ But it is a spirit in people,
>  “ The breath of the Almighty,
>  “ That makes them understand.
###### 9
>  “ It is not the aged who are wise,
>  “ Nor old men who understand what is right.
###### 10
>  “ Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me.
>  ‘ I, even I, will explain what I know.’
###### ¶ 11
>  “ Look, I waited for you to speak;
>  “ I listened closely to your wise thoughts, while you were searching for words.
###### 12
>  “ Now I was paying you close attention,
>  “ Yet there was no one proving Job wrong,
>  “ Not one of you was answering his statements.
###### 13
>  “ So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom.
>  ‘ God will refute him, not man.’
###### 14
>  “ Job has not directed his words to me,
>  “ And so I will not reply to him with your arguments.”
## Job’s Friends Failed to Answer
###### ¶ 15
>  “ They are dismayed and cannot answer anymore;
>  “ They have nothing left to say.
###### 16
>  “ And I have waited. But because they do not speak,
>  “ Because they stand there and answer no more,
###### 17
>  “ I too will answer my part,
>  “ I too will explain what I know.
###### 18
>  “ For I am full of words,
>  “ And the spirit within me constrains me.
###### 19
>  “ Inside I am like wine that has no outlet,
>  “ Like new wineskins ready to burst!
###### 20
>  “ I will speak, so that I may find relief;
>  “ I will open my lips, so that I may answer.
###### 21
>  “ I will not show partiality to any person,
>  “ Nor will I confer a title on anyone.
###### 22
>  “ For I do not know how to give honorary titles,
>  “ If I did, my Creator would quickly do away with me.
