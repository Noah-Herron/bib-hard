# Job 27
## A Protest of Innocence
###### ¶ 1
And Job took up his discourse again:
###### 2
>  “ As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice,
>  “ The Almighty, who has made my life bitter—
###### 3
>  “ For while my spirit is still in me,
>  “ And the breath from God is in my nostrils,
###### 4
>  “ My lips will not speak wickedness,
>  “ And my tongue will whisper no deceit.
###### 5
>  “ I will never declare that you three are in the right;
>  “ Until I die, I will not set aside my integrity!
###### 6
>  “ I will maintain my righteousness
>  “ And never let it go;
>  “ My conscience will not reproach me
>  “ For as long as I live.”
## The Condition of the Wicked
###### ¶ 7
>  “ May my enemy be like the wicked,
>  “ My adversary like the unrighteous.
###### 8
>  “ For what hope does the godless have when he is cut off,
>  “ When God takes away his life?
###### 9
>  “ Does God listen to his cry
>  “ When distress overtakes him?
###### 10
>  “ Will he find delight in the Almighty?
>  “ Will he call out to God at all times?
###### 11
>  “ I will teach you about the power of God;
>  “ What is on the Almighty’s mind I will not conceal.
###### 12
>  “ If you yourselves have all seen this,
>  “ Why in the world do you continue this meaningless talk?
###### ¶ 13
>  “ This is the portion of the wicked man
>  “ Allotted by God,
>  “ The inheritance that evildoers receive
>  “ From the Almighty.
###### 14
>  “ If his children increase—it is for the sword!
>  “ His offspring never have enough to eat.
###### 15
>  “ Those who survive him are buried by the plague,
>  “ And their widows do not mourn for them.
###### 16
>  “ If he piles up silver like dust
>  “ And stores up clothing like mounds of clay,
###### 17
>  “ What he stores up a righteous man will wear,
>  “ And an innocent man will inherit his silver.
###### 18
>  “ The house he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon,
>  “ Like a hut that a watchman has made.
###### 19
>  “ He goes to bed wealthy, but will do so no more.
>  “ When he opens his eyes, it is all gone.
###### 20
>  “ Terrors overwhelm him like a flood;
>  “ At night a whirlwind carries him off.
###### 21
>  “ The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;
>  “ It sweeps him out of his place.
###### 22
>  “ It hurls itself against him without pity
>  “ As he flees headlong from its power.
###### 23
>  “ It claps its hands at him in derision
>  “ And hisses him away from his place.
