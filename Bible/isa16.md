# Isaiah 16
###### ¶ 1
> Send rams as tribute to the ruler of the land,
> From Sela in the wilderness
> To the hill of Daughter Zion.
###### 2
> At the fords of the Arnon
> The Moabite women are like a bird
> That flies about when forced from its nest.
###### 3
> “Bring a plan, make a decision.
> “Provide some shade in the middle of the day.
> “Hide the fugitives! Do not betray the one who tries to escape.
###### 4
> “Please let the Moabite fugitives live among you.
> “Hide them from the destroyer!”
> Certainly the one who applies pressure will cease;
> The destroyer will come to an end;
> Those who trample will disappear from the earth.
###### 5
> Then a trustworthy king will be established;
> He will rule in a reliable manner,
> This one from David’s family.
> He will be sure to make just decisions
> And will be experienced in executing justice.
###### ¶ 6
> We have heard about Moab’s pride—
> Their great arrogance—
> Their boasting, pride, and excess.
> But their boastful claims are empty.
###### 7
> So Moab wails over its demise—
> They all wail!
> Completely devastated, they moan
> About what has happened to the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
###### 8
> For the fields of Heshbon are dried up,
> As well as the vines of Sibmah.
> The rulers of the nations trample all over its vines,
> Which reach Jazer and spread to the wilderness;
> Their shoots spread out and cross the sea.
###### 9
> So I weep along with Jazer
> Over the vines of Sibmah.
> I will saturate you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh,
> For the conquering invaders shout triumphantly
> Over your fruit and crops.
###### 10
> Joy and happiness disappear from the orchards,
> And in the vineyards no one rejoices or shouts;
> No one treads out juice in the wine vats—
> I have brought the joyful shouts to an end.
###### 11
> So my heart constantly sighs for Moab, like the strumming of a harp,
> My inner being sighs for Kir Hareseth.
###### 12
> When the Moabites plead with all their might at their high places,
> And enter their temples to pray, their prayers will be ineffective.
###### ¶ 13
This is the message the LORD previously announced about Moab.
###### 14
Now the LORD makes this announcement: “Within exactly three years Moab’s splendor will disappear, along with all her many people; there will be only a few insignificant survivors left.”
