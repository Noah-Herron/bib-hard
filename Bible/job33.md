# Job 33
## Elihu Invites Job’s Attention
###### ¶ 1
>  “ But now, O Job, listen to my words,
>  “ And hear everything I have to say.
###### 2
>  “ See now, I have opened my mouth;
>  “ My tongue in my mouth has spoken.
###### 3
>  “ My words come from the uprightness of my heart,
>  “ And my lips will utter knowledge sincerely.
###### 4
>  “ The Spirit of God has made me,
>  “ And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
###### 5
>  “ Reply to me, if you can;
>  “ Set your arguments in order before me
>  “ And take your stand.
###### 6
>  “ Look, I am just like you in relation to God;
>  “ I too have been molded from clay.
###### 7
>  “ Therefore no fear of me should terrify you,
>  “ Nor should my pressure be heavy on you.”
## Elihu Rejects Job’s Plea of Innocence
###### ¶ 8
>  “ Indeed, you have said in my hearing
>  “ (I heard the sound of the words!):
###### 9
>  ‘ I am pure, without transgression;
>  ‘ I am clean and have no iniquity.
###### 10
>  ‘ Yet God finds occasions with me;
>  ‘ He regards me as his enemy.
###### 11
>  ‘ He puts my feet in shackles;
>  ‘ He watches closely all my paths.’
###### 12
>  “ Now in this, you are not right—I answer you,
>  “ For God is greater than a human being.
###### ¶ 13
>  “ Why do you contend against him,
>  “ That he does not answer all a person’s words?”
## Elihu Disagrees With Job’s View of God
###### 14
>  “ For God speaks, the first time in one way,
>  “ The second time in another,
>  “ Though a person does not perceive it.
###### 15
>  “ In a dream, a night vision,
>  “ When deep sleep falls on people
>  “ As they sleep in their beds.
###### 16
>  “ Then he gives a revelation to people,
>  “ And terrifies them with warnings,
###### 17
>  “ To turn a person from his sin,
>  “ And to cover a person’s pride.
###### 18
>  “ He spares a person’s life from corruption,
>  “ His very life from crossing over the river.
###### ¶ 19
>  “ Or a person is chastened by pain on his bed,
>  “ And with the continual strife of his bones,
###### 20
>  “ So that his life loathes food,
>  “ And his soul rejects appetizing fare.
###### 21
>  “ His flesh wastes away from sight,
>  “ And his bones, which were not seen,
>  “ Are easily visible.
###### 22
>  “ He draws near to the place of corruption,
>  “ And his life to the messengers of death.
###### ¶ 23
>  “ If there is an angel beside him,
>  “ One mediator out of a thousand,
>  “ To tell a person what constitutes his uprightness;
###### 24
>  “ And if God is gracious to him and says,
>  ‘ Spare him from going down
>  ‘ To the place of corruption,
>  ‘ I have found a ransom for him,’
###### 25
>  “ Then his flesh is restored like a youth’s;
>  “ He returns to the days of his youthful vigor.
###### 26
>  “ He entreats God, and God delights in him,
>  “ He sees God’s face with rejoicing,
>  “ And God restores to him his righteousness.
###### 27
>  “ That person sings to others, saying:
>  ‘ I have sinned and falsified what is right,
>  ‘ But I was not punished according to what I deserved.
###### 28
>  ‘ He redeemed my life
>  ‘ From going down to the place of corruption,
>  ‘ And my life sees the light!’
## Elihu’s Appeal to Job
###### ¶ 29
>  “ Indeed, God does all these things,
>  “ Twice, three times, in his dealings with a person,
###### 30
>  “ To turn back his life from the place of corruption,
>  “ That he may be enlightened with the light of life.
###### 31
>  “ Pay attention, Job—listen to me;
>  “ Be silent, and I will speak.
###### 32
>  “ If you have any words, reply to me;
>  “ Speak, for I want to justify you.
###### 33
>  “ If not, you listen to me;
>  “ Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
