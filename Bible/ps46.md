> He is truly our helper in times of trouble.
###### 2

> And the mountains shake before the surging sea. (Selah)
###### ¶ 4
> The river’s channels bring joy to the city of God,
> The special, holy dwelling place of the Most High.

> God rescues it at the break of dawn.
###### 6

> The God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah)
###### ¶ 8

>  “ I will be exalted over the nations! I will be exalted over the earth!”
###### 11
