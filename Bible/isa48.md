# Isaiah 48
## The Lord Appeals to the Exiles
###### ¶ 1
> Listen to this, O family of Jacob,
> You who are called by the name ‘Israel,’
>  “ And are descended from Judah,
>  “ Who take oaths in the name of the LORD,
>  “ And invoke the God of Israel—
>  “ But not in an honest and just manner.
###### 2
>  “ Indeed, they live in the holy city;
>  “ They trust in the God of Israel,
>  “ Whose name is the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 3
>  “ I announced events beforehand,
>  “ I issued the decrees and made the predictions;
>  “ Suddenly I acted and they came to pass.
###### 4
>  “ I did this because I know how stubborn you are.
>  “ Your neck muscles are like iron
>  “ And your forehead like bronze.
###### 5
>  “ I announced them to you beforehand;
>  “ Before they happened, I predicted them for you,
>  “ So you could never say,
>  ‘ My image did these things,
>  ‘ My idol, my cast image, decreed them.’
###### 6
>  “ You have heard; now look at all the evidence!
>  “ Will you not admit that what I say is true?
>  “ From this point on I am announcing to you new events
>  “ That are previously unrevealed and you do not know about.
###### 7
>  “ Now they come into being, not in the past;
>  “ Before today you did not hear about them,
>  “ So you could not say,
>  ‘ Yes, I know about them.’
###### 8
>  “ You did not hear,
>  “ You do not know,
>  “ You were not told beforehand.
>  “ For I know that you are very deceitful;
>  “ You were labeled a rebel from birth.
###### 9
>  “ For the sake of my reputation I hold back my anger;
>  “ For the sake of my prestige I restrain myself from destroying you.
###### 10
>  “ Look, I have refined you, but not as silver;
>  “ I have purified you in the furnace of misery.
###### 11
>  “ For my sake alone I will act,
>  “ For how can I allow my name to be defiled?
>  “ I will not share my glory with anyone else!
###### ¶ 12
>  “ Listen to me, O Jacob,
>  “ Israel, whom I summoned.
>  “ I am the one;
>  “ I am present at the very beginning
>  “ And at the very end.
###### 13
>  “ Yes, my hand founded the earth;
>  “ My right hand spread out the sky.
>  “ I summon them;
>  “ They stand together.
###### 14
>  “ All of you, gather together and listen!
>  “ Who among them announced these things?
>  “ The LORD’s ally will carry out his desire against Babylon;
>  “ He will exert his power against the Babylonians.
###### 15
>  “ I, I have spoken—
>  “ Yes, I have summoned him;
>  “ I lead him and he will succeed.
###### 16
>  “ Approach me—listen to this!
>  “ From the very first I have not spoken in secret;
>  “ When it happens, I am there.”
> So now, the Sovereign LORD has sent me, accompanied by his Spirit.
###### ¶ 17
> This is what the LORD, your Protector, says,
> The Holy One of Israel:
>  “ I am the LORD your God,
>  “ Who teaches you how to succeed,
>  “ Who leads you in the way you should go.
###### 18
>  “ If only you had obeyed my commandments,
>  “ Prosperity would have flowed to you like a river,
>  “ Deliverance would have come to you like the waves of the sea.
###### 19
>  “ Your descendants would have been as numerous as sand,
>  “ And your children like its granules.
>  “ Their name would not have been cut off
>  “ And eliminated from my presence.
###### ¶ 20
>  “ Leave Babylon!
>  “ Flee from the Babylonians!
>  “ Announce it with a shout of joy!
>  “ Make this known—
>  “ Proclaim it throughout the earth!
>  “ Say, ‘The LORD protects his servant Jacob.
###### 21
>  ‘ They do not thirst as he leads them through dry regions;
>  ‘ He makes water flow out of a rock for them;
>  ‘ He splits open a rock and water flows out.’
###### 22
>  “ There will be no prosperity for the wicked,” says the LORD.
