# Proverbs 17
###### ¶ 1
> Better is a dry crust of bread where there is quietness
> Than a house full of feasting with strife.
###### 2
> A servant who acts wisely will rule
> Over an heir who behaves shamefully,
> And will share the inheritance along with the relatives.
###### 3
> The crucible is for refining silver and the furnace is for gold,
> Likewise the LORD tests hearts.
###### 4
> One who acts wickedly pays attention to evil counsel;
> A liar listens to a malicious tongue.
###### 5
> The one who mocks the poor has insulted his Creator;
> Whoever rejoices over disaster will not go unpunished.
###### 6
> Grandchildren are like a crown to the elderly,
> And the glory of children is their parents.
###### 7
> Excessive speech is not becoming for a fool;
> How much less are lies for a ruler!
###### 8
> A bribe works like a charm for the one who offers it;
> In whatever he does he succeeds.
###### 9
> The one who forgives an offense seeks love,
> But whoever repeats a matter separates close friends.
###### 10
> A rebuke makes a greater impression on a discerning person
> Than a hundred blows on a fool.
###### 11
> An evil person seeks only rebellion,
> And so a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
###### 12
> It is better for a person to meet a mother bear being robbed of her cubs,
> Than to encounter a fool in his folly.
###### 13
> As for the one who repays evil for good,
> Evil will not leave his house.
###### 14
> Starting a quarrel is like letting out water;
> Abandon strife before it breaks out!
###### 15
> The one who acquits the guilty and the one who condemns the innocent—
> Both of them are an abomination to the LORD.
###### 16
> What’s the point of a fool having money in hand
> To buy wisdom, when his head is empty?
###### 17
> A friend loves at all times,
> And a relative is born to help in adversity.
###### 18
> The one who lacks sense strikes hands in pledge,
> And puts up financial security for his neighbor.
###### 19
> The one who loves a quarrel loves transgression;
> Whoever builds his gate high seeks destruction.
###### 20
> The one who has a perverse heart does not find good,
> And the one who is deceitful in speech falls into trouble.
###### 21
> Whoever brings a fool into the world does so to his grief,
> And the father of a fool has no joy.
###### 22
> A cheerful heart brings good healing,
> But a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
###### 23
> A wicked person receives a bribe secretly
> To pervert the ways of justice.
###### 24
> Wisdom is directly in front of the discerning person,
> But the eyes of a fool run to the ends of the earth.
###### 25
> A foolish child is a grief to his father,
> And bitterness to the mother who bore him.
###### 26
> It is terrible to punish a righteous person,
> And to flog honorable men is wrong.
###### 27
> The truly wise person restrains his words,
> And the one who stays calm is discerning.
###### 28
> Even a fool who remains silent is considered wise,
> And the one who holds his tongue is deemed discerning.
