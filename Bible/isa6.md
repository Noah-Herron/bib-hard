# Isaiah 6
## Isaiah’s Commission
###### ¶ 1
In the year of King Uzziah’s death, I saw the Lord seated on a high, elevated throne. The hem of his robe filled the temple.
###### 2
Seraphs stood over him; each one had six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and they used the remaining two to fly.
###### 3
They called out to one another, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Heaven’s Armies! His majestic splendor fills the entire earth!”
###### 4
The sound of their voices shook the door frames, and the temple was filled with smoke.
###### 5
I said, “Woe to me! I am destroyed, for my lips are contaminated by sin, and I live among people whose lips are contaminated by sin. My eyes have seen the king, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.”
###### ¶ 6
But then one of the seraphs flew toward me. In his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.
###### 7
He touched my mouth with it and said, “Look, this coal has touched your lips. Your evil is removed; your sin is forgiven.”
###### 8
I heard the voice of the Lord say, “Whom will I send? Who will go on our behalf?” I answered, “Here I am, send me!”
###### 9
He said, “Go and tell these people:
>  “ ‘Listen continually, but don’t understand.
>  “ Look continually, but don’t perceive.’
###### 10
>  “ Make the hearts of these people calloused;
>  “ Make their ears deaf and their eyes blind.
>  “ Otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
>  “ Their hearts might understand and they might repent and be healed.”
###### 11
> I replied, “How long, Lord?” He said,
>  “ Until cities are in ruins and unpopulated,
>  “ And houses are uninhabited,
>  “ And the land is ruined and devastated,
###### 12
>  “ And the LORD has sent the people off to a distant place,
>  “ And the very heart of the land is completely abandoned.
###### 13
>  “ Even if only a tenth of the people remain in the land,
>  “ It will again be destroyed,
>  “ Like one of the large sacred trees or an Asherah pole,
>  “ When a sacred pillar on a high place is thrown down.
>  “ That sacred pillar symbolizes the special chosen family.”
