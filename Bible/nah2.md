# Nahum 2
## Proclamation of the Destruction of Nineveh
###### ¶ 1
>  An enemy who will scatter you, Nineveh, has advanced against you!
> Guard the rampart!
> Watch the road!
> Prepare yourselves for battle!
> Muster your mighty strength!
###### 2
> For the LORD is about to restore the majesty of Jacob,
> As well as the majesty of Israel,
> Though their enemies have plundered them
> And have destroyed their fields.
## Prophetic Vision of the Fall of Nineveh
###### ¶ 3
> The shields of his warriors are dyed red;
> The mighty soldiers are dressed in scarlet garments.
> The chariots are in flashing metal fittings
> On the day of battle;
> The soldiers brandish their spears.
###### 4
> The chariots race madly through the streets,
> They rush back and forth in the broad plazas;
> They look like lightning bolts,
> They dash here and there like flashes of lightning.
###### 5
> The commander orders his officers;
> They stumble as they advance;
> They rush to the city wall,
> And they set up the covered siege tower.
###### 6
> The sluice gates are opened;
> The royal palace is deluged and dissolves.
###### 7
> Nineveh is taken into exile and is led away;
> Her slave girls moan like doves while they beat their breasts.
###### ¶ 8
> Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,
> But now her people are running away;
> She cries out: “Stop! Stop!”—
> But no one turns back.
###### 9
> Her conquerors cry out:
>  “ Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”
> There is no end to the treasure;
> Riches of every kind of precious thing.
###### 10
> Destruction, devastation, and desolation!
> Hearts faint, knees tremble;
> Every stomach churns, all their faces have turned pale!
## Taunt against the Once-Mighty Lion
###### 11
> Where now is the den of the lions
> And the feeding place of the young lions,
> Where the lion, lioness, and lion cub once prowled
> And no one disturbed them?
###### 12
> The lion tore apart as much prey as his cubs needed
> And strangled prey for his lionesses;
> He filled his lairs with prey
> And his dens with torn flesh.
## Battle Cry of the Divine Warrior
###### ¶ 13
>  “ I am against you!” declares the LORD of Heaven’s Armies:
>  “ I will burn your chariots with fire;
>  “ The sword will devour your young lions.
>  “ You will no longer prey upon the land;
>  “ The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”
