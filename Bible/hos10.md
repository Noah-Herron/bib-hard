# Hosea 10
## Israel is Guilty of Fertility Cult Worship
###### ¶ 1
> Israel was a fertile vine
> That yielded fruit.
> As his fruit multiplied,
> He multiplied altars to Baal.
> As his land prospered,
> They adorned the fertility pillars.
###### 2
> Their hearts are slipping;
> Soon they will be punished for their guilt.
> The LORD will break their altars;
> He will completely destroy their fertility pillars.
## The Lord Will Punish Israel by Removing Its Kings
###### ¶ 3
> Very soon they will say, “We have no king
>  “ Since we did not fear the LORD.
>  “ But what can a king do for us anyway?”
###### 4
> They utter empty words,
> Taking false oaths and making empty agreements.
> Therefore legal disputes sprout up
> Like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a plowed field.
## The Calf Idol and Idolaters of Samaria Will Be Exiled
###### 5
> The inhabitants of Samaria will lament over the calf idol of Beth Aven.
> Its people will mourn over it;
> Its idolatrous priests will wail over it,
> Because its splendor will be taken from them into exile.
###### 6
> Even the calf idol will be carried to Assyria,
> As tribute for the great king.
> Ephraim will be disgraced;
> Israel will be put to shame because of its wooden idol.
###### 7
> Samaria and its king will be carried off
> Like a twig on the surface of the waters.
###### 8
> The high places of the “House of Wickedness” will be destroyed;
> It is the place where Israel sins.
> Thorns and thistles will grow up over its altars.
> Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!”
> And to the hills, “Fall on us!”
## Failure to Learn from the Sin and Judgment of Gibeah
###### 9
> O Israel, you have sinned since the time of Gibeah,
> And there you have remained.
> Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?
###### 10
> When I please, I will discipline them;
> I will gather nations together to attack them,
> To bind them in chains for their two sins.
## Fertility Imagery: Plowing, Sowing, and Reaping
###### ¶ 11
> Ephraim was a well-trained heifer who loved to thresh grain;
> I myself put a fine yoke on her neck.
> I will harness Ephraim.
> Let Judah plow!
> Let Jacob break up the unplowed ground for himself!
###### 12
> Sow righteousness for yourselves,
> Reap unfailing love.
> Break up the unplowed ground for yourselves,
> For it is time to seek the LORD,
> Until he comes and showers deliverance on you.
###### 13
> But you have plowed wickedness;
> You have reaped injustice;
> You have eaten the fruit of deception.
> Because you have depended on your chariots;
> You have relied on your many warriors.
## Bethel Will Be Destroyed Like Beth Arbel
###### 14
> The roar of battle will rise against your people;
> All your fortresses will be devastated,
> Just as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle,
> When mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.
###### 15
> So will it happen to you, O Bethel,
> Because of your great wickedness!
> When that day dawns,
> The king of Israel will be destroyed.
