# Psalm 126
###### ¶ 1
> When the LORD restored the well-being of Zion,
> We thought we were dreaming.
###### 2
> At that time we laughed loudly
> And shouted for joy.
> At that time the nations said,
>  “ The LORD has accomplished great things for these people.”
###### 3
> The LORD did indeed accomplish great things for us.
> We were happy.
###### ¶ 4
> O LORD, restore our well-being,
> Just as the streams in the arid south are replenished.
###### 5
> Those who shed tears as they plant
> Will shout for joy when they reap the harvest.
###### 6
> The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag of seed,
> Will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain.
