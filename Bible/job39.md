# Job 39
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Are you acquainted with the way
>  “ The mountain goats give birth?
>  “ Do you watch as the wild deer give birth to their young?
###### 2
>  “ Do you count the months they must fulfill,
>  “ And do you know the time they give birth?
###### 3
>  “ They crouch, they bear their young,
>  “ They bring forth the offspring they have carried.
###### 4
>  “ Their young grow strong, and grow up in the open;
>  “ They go off, and do not return to them.
###### ¶ 5
>  “ Who let the wild donkey go free?
>  “ Who released the bonds of the donkey,
###### 6
>  “ To whom I appointed the arid rift valley for its home,
>  “ The salt wastes as its dwelling place?
###### 7
>  “ It scorns the tumult in the town;
>  “ It does not hear the shouts of a driver.
###### 8
>  “ It ranges the hills as its pasture,
>  “ And searches after every green plant.
###### 9
>  “ Is the wild ox willing to be your servant?
>  “ Will it spend the night at your feeding trough?
###### 10
>  “ Can you bind the wild ox to a furrow with its rope,
>  “ Will it till the valleys, following after you?
###### 11
>  “ Will you rely on it because its strength is great?
>  “ Will you commit your labor to it?
###### 12
>  “ Can you count on it to bring in your grain,
>  “ And gather the grain to your threshing floor?
###### ¶ 13
>  “ The wings of the ostrich flap with joy,
>  “ But are they the pinions and plumage of a stork?
###### 14
>  “ For she leaves her eggs on the ground,
>  “ And lets them be warmed on the soil.
###### 15
>  “ She forgets that a foot might crush them,
>  “ Or that a wild animal might trample them.
###### 16
>  “ She is harsh with her young,
>  “ As if they were not hers;
>  “ She is unconcerned about the uselessness of her labor.
###### 17
>  “ For God deprived her of wisdom,
>  “ And did not impart understanding to her.
###### 18
>  “ But as soon as she springs up,
>  “ She laughs at the horse and its rider.
###### ¶ 19
>  “ Do you give the horse its strength?
>  “ Do you clothe its neck with a mane?
###### 20
>  “ Do you make it leap like a locust?
>  “ Its proud neighing is terrifying!
###### 21
>  “ It paws the ground in the valley,
>  “ Exulting mightily,
>  “ It goes out to meet the weapons.
###### 22
>  “ It laughs at fear and is not dismayed;
>  “ It does not shy away from the sword.
###### 23
>  “ On it the quiver rattles;
>  “ The lance and javelin flash.
###### 24
>  “ In excitement and impatience it consumes the ground;
>  “ It cannot stand still when the trumpet is blown.
###### 25
>  “ At the sound of the trumpet, it says, ‘Aha!’
>  “ And from a distance it catches the scent of battle,
>  “ The thunderous shouting of commanders,
>  “ And the battle cries.
###### ¶ 26
>  “ Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars,
>  “ And spreads its wings toward the south?
###### 27
>  “ Is it at your command that the eagle soars,
>  “ And builds its nest on high?
###### 28
>  “ It lives on a rock and spends the night there,
>  “ On a rocky crag and a fortress.
###### 29
>  “ From there it spots its prey,
>  “ Its eyes gaze intently from a distance.
###### 30
>  “ And its young ones devour the blood,
>  “ And where the dead carcasses are,
>  “ There it is.”
