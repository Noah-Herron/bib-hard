# Isaiah 43
## The Lord Will Rescue His People
###### ¶ 1
> Now, this is what the LORD says,
> The one who created you, O Jacob,
> And formed you, O Israel:
>  “ Don’t be afraid, for I will protect you.
>  “ I call you by name, you are mine.
###### 2
>  “ When you pass through the waters, I am with you;
>  “ When you pass through the streams, they will not overwhelm you.
>  “ When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned;
>  “ The flames will not harm you.
###### 3
>  “ For I am the LORD your God,
>  “ The Holy One of Israel, your deliverer.
>  “ I have handed over Egypt as a ransom price,
>  “ Ethiopia and Seba in place of you.
###### 4
>  “ Since you are precious and special in my sight,
>  “ And I love you,
>  “ I will hand over people in place of you,
>  “ Nations in place of your life.
###### 5
>  “ Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.
>  “ From the east I will bring your descendants;
>  “ From the west I will gather you.
###### 6
>  “ I will say to the north, ‘Hand them over!’
>  “ And to the south, ‘Don’t hold any back!’
>  “ Bring my sons from distant lands,
>  “ And my daughters from the remote regions of the earth,
###### 7
>  “ Everyone who belongs to me,
>  “ Whom I created for my glory,
>  “ Whom I formed—yes, whom I made.”
## The Lord Declares His Sovereignty
###### ¶ 8
>  “ Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes,
>  “ Those who are deaf, even though they have ears!
###### 9
>  “ All nations gather together,
>  “ The peoples assemble.
>  “ Who among them announced this?
>  “ Who predicted earlier events for us?
>  “ Let them produce their witnesses to testify they were right;
>  “ Let them listen and affirm, “It is true.”
###### 10
> You are my witnesses,” says the LORD,
>  “ My servant whom I have chosen,
>  “ So that you may consider and believe in me,
>  “ And understand that I am he.
>  “ No god was formed before me,
>  “ And none will outlive me.
###### 11
>  “ I, I am the LORD,
>  “ And there is no deliverer besides me.
###### 12
>  “ I decreed and delivered and proclaimed,
>  “ And there was no other god among you.
>  “ You are my witnesses,” says the LORD, “that I am God.
###### 13
>  “ From this day forward I am he;
> No one can deliver from my power;
> I will act, and who can prevent it?”
## The Lord Will Do Something New
###### ¶ 14
> This is what the LORD says,
> Your Protector, the Holy One of Israel:
>  “ For your sake I send to Babylon
>  “ And make them all fugitives,
>  “ Turning the Babylonians’ joyful shouts into mourning songs.
###### 15
>  “ I am the LORD, your Holy One,
>  “ The one who created Israel, your king.”
###### 16
> This is what the LORD says,
> The one who made a road through the sea,
> A pathway through the surging waters,
###### 17
> The one who led chariots and horses to destruction,
> Together with a mighty army.
> They fell down, never to rise again;
> They were extinguished, put out like a burning wick:
###### 18
>  “ Don’t remember these earlier events;
>  “ Don’t recall these former events.
###### 19
>  “ Look, I am about to do something new.
>  “ Now it begins to happen! Do you not recognize it?
>  “ Yes, I will make a road in the wilderness
>  “ And paths in the wastelands.
###### 20
>  “ The wild animals honor me,
>  “ The jackals and ostriches,
>  “ Because I put water in the wilderness
>  “ And streams in the wastelands,
>  “ To quench the thirst of my chosen people,
###### 21
>  “ The people whom I formed for myself,
>  “ So they might praise me.”
## The Lord Rebukes His People
###### ¶ 22
>  “ But you did not call for me, O Jacob;
>  “ You did not long for me, O Israel.
###### 23
>  “ You did not bring me lambs for your burnt offerings;
>  “ You did not honor me with your sacrifices.
>  “ I did not burden you with offerings;
>  “ I did not make you weary by demanding incense.
###### 24
>  “ You did not buy me aromatic reeds;
>  “ You did not present to me the fat of your sacrifices.
>  “ Yet you burdened me with your sins;
>  “ You made me weary with your evil deeds.
###### ¶ 25
>  “ I, I am the one who blots out your rebellious deeds for my sake;
>  “ Your sins I do not remember.
###### 26
>  “ Remind me of what happened. Let’s debate!
>  “ You, prove to me that you are right!
###### 27
>  “ The father of your nation sinned;
>  “ Your spokesmen rebelled against me.
###### 28
>  “ So I defiled your holy princes,
>  “ And handed Jacob over to destruction,
>  “ And subjected Israel to humiliating abuse.
