# Psalm 48
###### ¶ 1
> The LORD is great and certainly worthy of praise
> In the city of our God, his holy hill.
###### 2
> It is lofty and pleasing to look at,
> A source of joy to the whole earth.
> Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon;
> It is the city of the great king.
###### 3
> God is in its fortresses;
> He reveals himself as its defender.
###### ¶ 4
> For look, the kings assemble;
> They advance together.
###### 5
> As soon as they see, they are shocked;
> They are terrified, they quickly retreat.
###### 6
> Look at them shake uncontrollably,
> Like a woman writhing in childbirth.
###### 7
> With an east wind
> You shatter the large ships.
###### 8
> We heard about God’s mighty deeds; now we have seen them,
> In the city of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> In the city of our God.
> God makes it permanently secure. (Selah)
###### ¶ 9
> Within your temple
> We reflect on your loyal love, O God.
###### 10
> The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth
> Is worthy of your reputation, O God.
> You execute justice.
###### 11
> Mount Zion rejoices;
> The towns of Judah are happy,
> Because of your acts of judgment.
###### 12
> Walk around Zion. Encircle it.
> Count its towers.
###### 13
> Consider its defenses.
> Walk through its fortresses,
> So you can tell the next generation about it.
###### 14
> For God, our God, is our defender forever.
> He guides us.
