# Song of Songs 6
## The Lost Lover Found
###### ¶ 1
> Where has your beloved gone,
O most beautiful among women?
Where has your beloved turned?
Tell us, that we may seek him with you.
###### ¶ 2
> My beloved has gone down to his garden,
> To the flowerbeds of balsam spices,
> To graze in the gardens,
> And to gather lilies.
## Poetic Refrain: Mutual Possession
###### 3
> I am my lover’s and my lover is mine;
> He grazes among the lilies.
## The Renewal of Love
###### ¶ 4
> My darling, you are as beautiful as Tirzah,
> As lovely as Jerusalem,
> As awe-inspiring as bannered armies.
###### 5
> Turn your eyes away from me—
> They overwhelm me!
> Your hair is like a flock of goats
> Descending from Mount Gilead.
###### 6
> Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
> Coming up from the washing;
> Each has its twin;
> Not one of them is missing.
###### 7
> Like a slice of pomegranate
> Is your forehead behind your veil.
###### 8
> There may be sixty queens,
> And eighty concubines,
> And young women without number.
###### 9
> But she is unique,
> My dove, my perfect one!
> She is the special daughter of her mother;
> She is the favorite of the one who bore her.
> The maidens saw her and complimented her;
> The queens and concubines praised her:
###### 10
>  “ Who is this who appears like the dawn?
>  “ Beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun,
>  “ Awe-inspiring as the stars in procession?”
## The Return to the Vineyards
###### ¶ 11
> I went down to the orchard of walnut trees,
> To look for the blossoms of the valley,
> To see if the vines had budded
> Or if the pomegranates were in bloom.
###### 12
> I was beside myself with joy!
> There please give me your myrrh,
> O daughter of my princely people.
## The Love Song and Dance
###### ¶ 13
>  Turn, turn, O Perfect One!
Turn, turn, that I may stare at you!
> Why do you gaze upon the Perfect One
> Like the dance of the Mahanaim?
