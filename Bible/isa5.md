# Isaiah 5
## A Love Song Gone Sour
###### ¶ 1
> I will sing to my love—
> A song to my lover about his vineyard.
> My love had a vineyard
> On a fertile hill.
###### 2
> He built a hedge around it, removed its stones,
> And planted a vine.
> He built a tower in the middle of it,
> And constructed a winepress.
> He waited for it to produce edible grapes,
> But it produced sour ones instead.
###### ¶ 3
> So now, residents of Jerusalem,
> People of Judah,
> You decide between me and my vineyard!
###### 4
> What more can I do for my vineyard
> Beyond what I have already done?
> When I waited for it to produce edible grapes,
> Why did it produce sour ones instead?
###### 5
> Now I will inform you
> What I am about to do to my vineyard:
> I will remove its hedge and turn it into pasture,
> I will break its wall and allow animals to graze there.
###### 6
> I will make it a wasteland;
> No one will prune its vines or hoe its ground,
> And thorns and briers will grow there.
> I will order the clouds
> Not to drop any rain on it.
###### ¶ 7
> Indeed, Israel is the vineyard of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> The people of Judah are the cultivated place in which he took delight.
> He waited for justice, but look what he got—disobedience!
> He waited for fairness, but look what he got—cries for help!
## Disaster is Coming
###### ¶ 8
> Beware, those who accumulate houses,
> Who also accumulate field after field
> Until there is no land left,
> And you are the only landowners remaining within the land.
###### 9
> The LORD of Heaven’s Armies told me this:
>  “ Many houses will certainly become desolate,
>  “ Large, impressive houses will have no one living in them.
###### 10
>  “ Indeed, a large vineyard will produce just a few gallons,
>  “ And enough seed to yield several bushels will produce less than a bushel.”
###### ¶ 11
> Beware, those who get up early to drink beer,
> Those who keep drinking long after dark
> Until they are intoxicated with wine.
###### 12
> They have stringed instruments, tambourines, flutes,
> And wine at their parties.
> So they do not recognize what the LORD is doing,
> They do not perceive what he is bringing about.
###### ¶ 13
> Therefore my people will be deported
> Because of their lack of understanding.
> Their leaders will have nothing to eat,
> Their masses will have nothing to drink.
###### 14
> So Death will open up its throat,
> And open wide its mouth;
> Zion’s dignitaries and masses will descend into it,
> Including those who revel and celebrate within her.
###### 15
> Men will be humiliated,
> They will be brought low;
> The proud will be brought low.
###### 16
> The LORD of Heaven’s Armies will be exalted when he punishes,
> The holy God’s authority will be recognized when he judges.
###### 17
> Lambs will graze as if in their pastures,
> Amid the ruins the rich sojourners will graze.
###### ¶ 18
> Beware, those who pull evil along using cords of emptiness are as good as dead,
> Who pull sin as with cart ropes.
###### 19
> They say, “Let him hurry, let him act quickly,
>  “ So we can see;
>  “ Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel take shape and come to pass,
>  “ Then we will know it!”
###### ¶ 20
> Beware, those who call evil good and good evil,
> Who turn darkness into light and light into darkness,
> Who turn bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter.
###### 21
> Beware, those who think they are wise,
> Those who think they possess understanding.
###### 22
> Beware, those who are champions at drinking,
> Who display great courage when mixing strong drinks.
###### 23
> They pronounce the guilty innocent for a payoff,
> They ignore the just cause of the innocent.
###### ¶ 24
> Therefore, as flaming fire devours straw,
> And dry grass disintegrates in the flames,
> So their root will rot,
> And their flower will blow away like dust.
> For they have rejected the law of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> They have spurned the commands of the Holy One of Israel.
###### 25
> So the LORD is furious with his people;
> He lifts his hand and strikes them.
> The mountains shake,
> And corpses lie like manure in the middle of the streets.
> Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
> And his hand is ready to strike again.
###### ¶ 26
> He lifts a signal flag for a distant nation,
> He whistles for it to come from the far regions of the earth.
> Look, they come quickly and swiftly.
###### 27
> None tire or stumble,
> They don’t stop to nap or sleep.
>  “ They don’t loosen their belts,
>  “ Or unstrap their sandals to rest.
###### 28
>  “ Their arrows are sharpened,
>  “ And all their bows are prepared.
>  “ The hooves of their horses are hard as flint,
>  “ And their chariot wheels are like a windstorm.
###### 29
>  “ Their roar is like a lion’s;
>  “ They roar like young lions.
>  “ They growl and seize their prey;
>  “ They drag it away and no one can come to the rescue.
###### 30
>  “ At that time they will growl over their prey,
>  “ It will sound like sea waves crashing against rocks.
>  “ One will look out over the land and see the darkness of disaster,
>  “ Clouds will turn the light into darkness.
