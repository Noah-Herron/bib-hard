# Job 20
## Zophar’s Second Speech
###### ¶ 1
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
###### 2
>  “ This is why my troubled thoughts bring me back—
>  “ Because of my feelings within me.
###### 3
>  “ When I hear a reproof that dishonors me,
>  “ Then my understanding prompts me to answer.
###### 4
>  “ Surely you know that it has been from old,
>  “ Ever since humankind was placed on the earth,
###### 5
>  “ That the elation of the wicked is brief,
>  “ The joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
###### 6
>  “ Even though his stature reaches to the heavens
>  “ And his head touches the clouds,
###### 7
>  “ He will perish forever, like his own excrement;
>  “ Those who used to see him will say, ‘Where is he?’
###### 8
>  “ Like a dream he flies away, never again to be found,
>  “ And like a vision of the night he is put to flight.
###### 9
>  “ People who had seen him will not see him again,
>  “ And the place where he was
>  “ Will recognize him no longer.
###### 10
>  “ His sons must recompense the poor;
>  “ His own hands must return his wealth.
###### 11
>  “ His bones were full of his youthful vigor,
>  “ But that vigor will lie down with him in the dust.
###### ¶ 12
>  “ If evil is sweet in his mouth
>  “ And he hides it under his tongue,
###### 13
>  “ If he retains it for himself
>  “ And does not let it go,
>  “ And holds it fast in his mouth,
###### 14
>  “ His food is turned sour in his stomach;
>  “ It becomes the venom of serpents within him.
###### 15
>  “ The wealth that he consumed he vomits up,
>  “ God will make him throw it out of his stomach.
###### 16
>  “ He sucks the poison of serpents;
>  “ The fangs of a viper kill him.
###### 17
>  “ He will not look on the streams,
>  “ The rivers that are the torrents
>  “ Of honey and butter.
###### 18
>  “ He gives back the ill-gotten gain
>  “ Without assimilating it;
>  “ He will not enjoy the wealth from his commerce.
###### 19
>  “ For he has oppressed the poor and abandoned them;
>  “ He has seized a house which he did not build.
###### ¶ 20
>  “ For he knows no satisfaction in his appetite;
>  “ He does not let anything he desires escape.
###### 21
>  “ Nothing is left for him to devour;
>  “ That is why his prosperity does not last.
###### 22
>  “ In the fullness of his sufficiency,
>  “ Distress overtakes him.
>  “ The full force of misery will come upon him.
###### 23
>  “ While he is filling his belly,
>  “ God sends his burning anger against him,
>  “ And rains down his blows upon him.
###### 24
>  “ If he flees from an iron weapon,
>  “ Then an arrow from a bronze bow pierces him.
###### 25
>  “ When he pulls it out and it comes out of his back,
>  “ The gleaming point out of his liver,
>  “ Terrors come over him.
###### 26
>  “ Total darkness waits to receive his treasures;
>  “ A fire that has not been kindled
>  “ Will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
###### 27
>  “ The heavens reveal his iniquity;
>  “ The earth rises up against him.
###### 28
>  “ A flood will carry off his house,
>  “ Rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath.
###### 29
>  “ Such is the lot God allots the wicked,
>  “ And the heritage of his appointment from God.”
