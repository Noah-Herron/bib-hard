# Isaiah 53
###### ¶ 1
> Who would have believed what we just heard?
> When was the LORD’s power revealed through him?
###### 2
> He sprouted up like a twig before God,
> Like a root out of parched soil;
> He had no stately form or majesty that might catch our attention,
> No special appearance that we should want to follow him.
###### 3
> He was despised and rejected by people,
> One who experienced pain and was acquainted with illness;
> People hid their faces from him;
> He was despised, and we considered him insignificant.
###### ¶ 4
> But he lifted up our illnesses,
> He carried our pain;
> Even though we thought he was being punished,
> Attacked by God, and afflicted for something he had done.
###### 5
> He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds,
> Crushed because of our sins;
> He endured punishment that made us well;
> Because of his wounds we have been healed.
###### 6
> All of us had wandered off like sheep;
> Each of us had strayed off on his own path,
> But the LORD caused the sin of all of us to attack him.
###### ¶ 7
> He was treated harshly and afflicted,
> But he did not even open his mouth.
> Like a lamb led to the slaughtering block,
> Like a sheep silent before her shearers,
> He did not even open his mouth.
###### 8
> He was led away after an unjust trial—
> But who even cared?
> Indeed, he was cut off from the land of the living;
> Because of the rebellion of his own people he was wounded.
###### 9
> They intended to bury him with criminals,
> But he ended up in a rich man’s tomb,
> Because he had committed no violent deeds,
> Nor had he spoken deceitfully.
###### ¶ 10
> Though the LORD desired to crush him and make him ill,
> Once restitution is made,
> He will see descendants and enjoy long life,
> And the LORD’s purpose will be accomplished through him.
###### 11
> Having suffered, he will reflect on his work,
> He will be satisfied when he understands what he has done.
> “My servant will acquit many,
> “For he carried their sins.
###### 12
> “So I will assign him a portion with the multitudes,
> “He will divide the spoils of victory with the powerful,
> “Because he willingly submitted to death
> “And was numbered with the rebels,
> “When he lifted up the sin of many
> “And intervened on behalf of the rebels.”
