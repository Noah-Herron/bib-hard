and said,

> “And he answered me;
> “From the belly of Sheol I cried out for help,
> “And you heard my prayer.
###### 3
> “You threw me into the deep waters,
> “Into the middle of the sea;
> “The ocean current engulfed me;
> “All the mighty waves you sent swept over me.
###### 4
> “I thought I had been banished from your sight
> “And that I would never again see your holy temple.
###### 5
> “Water engulfed me up to my neck;
> “The deep ocean surrounded me;
> “Seaweed was wrapped around my head.
###### 6
> “I went down to the very bottoms of the mountains;
> “The gates of the netherworld barred me in forever,
> “But you brought me up from the Pit, O LORD, my God.
###### 7
> “When my life was ebbing away, I called out to the LORD.
> “And my prayer came to you, to your holy temple.
###### 8
> “Those who worship worthless idols forfeit the mercy that could be theirs.
###### 9
> “But as for me, I promise to offer a sacrifice to you with a public declaration of praise;
> “I will surely do what I have promised.
> “Salvation belongs to the LORD!”

Then the LORD commanded the fish and it vomited Jonah out onto dry land.
