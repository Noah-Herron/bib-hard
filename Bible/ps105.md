###### 3
> Boast about his holy name.
> Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
###### 4
> Seek the LORD and the strength he gives.
> Seek his presence continually.
###### 5
> Recall the miraculous deeds he performed,
> His mighty acts and the judgments he decreed,
###### 6

> You descendants of Jacob, God’s chosen ones.
###### 7
> He is the LORD our God;
> He carries out judgment throughout the earth.
###### ¶ 8
> He always remembers his covenantal decree,
> The promise he made to a thousand generations—
###### 9
> The promise he made to Abraham,
> The promise he made by oath to Isaac.
###### 10
> He gave it to Jacob as a decree,
> To Israel as a lasting promise,
###### 11
> Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
> “As the portion of your inheritance.”
###### 12
> When they were few in number,
> Just a very few, and resident foreigners within it,
###### 13
> They wandered from nation to nation,
> And from one kingdom to another.
###### 14
> He let no one oppress them;
> He disciplined kings for their sake,
###### 15
> Saying, “Don’t touch my chosen ones.
> “Don’t harm my prophets.”
###### ¶ 16
> He called down a famine upon the earth;
> He cut off all the food supply.
###### 17
> He sent a man ahead of them—
> Joseph was sold as a servant.
###### 18
> The shackles hurt his feet;
> His neck was placed in an iron collar,
###### 19
> Until the time when his prediction came true.
> The LORD’s word proved him right.
###### 20
> The king authorized his release;
> The ruler of nations set him free.
###### 21
> He put him in charge of his palace,
> And made him manager of all his property,
###### 22
> Giving him authority to imprison his officials
> And to teach his advisers.
###### 23
> Israel moved to Egypt;
> Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.
###### 24
> The LORD made his people very fruitful,
> And made them more numerous than their enemies.
###### ¶ 25
> He caused the Egyptians to hate his people,
> And to mistreat his servants.
###### 26
> He sent his servant Moses,
> And Aaron, whom he had chosen.
###### 27
> They executed his miraculous signs among them,
> And his amazing deeds in the land of Ham.
###### 28
> He made it dark;
> Moses and Aaron did not disobey his orders.
###### 29
> He turned the Egyptians’ water into blood,
> And killed their fish.
###### 30
> Their land was overrun by frogs,
> Which even got into the rooms of their kings.
###### 31
> He ordered flies to come;
> Gnats invaded their whole territory.
###### 32
> He sent hail along with the rain;
> There was lightning in their land.
###### 33
> He destroyed their vines and fig trees,
> And broke the trees throughout their territory.
###### 34
> He ordered locusts to come,
> Innumerable grasshoppers.
###### 35
> They ate all the vegetation in their land,
> And devoured the crops of their fields.
###### 36
> He struck down all the firstborn in their land,
> The firstfruits of their reproductive power.
###### ¶ 37
> He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold;
> None of his tribes stumbled.
###### 38
> Egypt was happy when they left,
> For they were afraid of them.
###### 39
> He spread out a cloud for a cover,
> And provided a fire to light up the night.
###### 40
> They asked for food, and he sent quail;
> He satisfied them with food from the sky.
###### 41
> He opened up a rock and water flowed out;
> A river ran through dry regions.
###### 42
> Yes, he remembered the sacred promise
> He made to Abraham his servant.
###### 43
> When he led his people out, they rejoiced;
> His chosen ones shouted with joy.
###### 44
> He handed the territory of nations over to them,
> And they took possession of what other peoples had produced,
###### 45
> So that they might keep his commands
> And obey his laws.
> Praise the LORD.
