# Isaiah 45
###### ¶ 1
> “This is what the LORD says to his chosen one,
> “To Cyrus, whose right hand I hold
> “In order to subdue nations before him,
> “And disarm kings,
> “To open doors before him,
> “So gates remain unclosed:
###### 2
> ‘I will go before you
> ‘And level mountains.
> ‘Bronze doors I will shatter
> ‘And iron bars I will hack through.
###### 3
> ‘I will give you hidden treasures,
> ‘Riches stashed away in secret places,
> ‘So you may recognize that I am the LORD,
> ‘The one who calls you by name, the God of Israel.
###### 4
> ‘For the sake of my servant Jacob,
> ‘Israel, my chosen one,
> ‘I call you by name
> ‘And give you a title of respect, even though you do not submit to me.
###### 5
> ‘I am the LORD, I have no peer,
> ‘There is no God but me.
> ‘I arm you for battle, even though you do not recognize me.
###### 6
> ‘I do this so people will recognize from east to west
> ‘That there is no God but me;
> ‘I am the LORD, I have no peer.
###### 7
> ‘I am the one who forms light
> ‘And creates darkness;
> ‘The one who brings about peace
> ‘And creates calamity.
> ‘I am the LORD, who accomplishes all these things.
###### ¶ 8
> ‘O sky, rain down from above!
> ‘Let the clouds send down showers of deliverance!
> ‘Let the earth absorb it so salvation may grow,
> ‘And deliverance may sprout up along with it.
> ‘I, the LORD, create it.’”
## The Lord Gives a Warning
###### ¶ 9
> One who argues with his Creator is in grave danger,
> One who is like a mere shard among the other shards on the ground!
> The clay should not say to the potter,
> “What in the world are you doing?
> “Your work lacks skill!”
###### 10
> Danger awaits one who says to his father,
> “What in the world are you fathering?”
> And to his mother,
> “What in the world are you bringing forth?”
###### ¶ 11
> This is what the LORD says,
> The Holy One of Israel, the one who formed him,
> Concerning things to come:
> “How dare you question me about my children!
> “How dare you tell me what to do with the work of my own hands!
###### 12
> “I made the earth;
> “I created the people who live on it.
> “It was me—my hands stretched out the sky.
> “I give orders to all the heavenly lights.
###### 13
> “It is me—I stir him up and commission him;
> “I will make all his ways level.
> “He will rebuild my city;
> “He will send my exiled people home,
> “But not for a price or a bribe,”
> Says the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.
## The Lord is the Nations’ Only Hope
###### ¶ 14
This is what the LORD says:
> “The profit of Egypt and the revenue of Ethiopia,
> “Along with the Sabeans, those tall men,
> “Will be brought to you and become yours.
> “They will walk behind you, coming along in chains.
> “They will bow down to you
> “And pray to you:
> ‘Truly God is with you; he has no peer;
> ‘There is no other God!’”
###### 15
> Yes, you are a God who keeps hidden,
> O God of Israel, deliverer!
###### 16
> They will all be ashamed and embarrassed;
> Those who fashion idols will all be humiliated.
###### 17
> Israel will be delivered once and for all by the LORD;
> You will never again be ashamed or humiliated.
###### ¶ 18
> For this is what the LORD says,
> The one who created the sky—
> He is the true God,
> The one who formed the earth and made it;
> He established it,
> He did not create it without order,
> He formed it to be inhabited:
> “I am the LORD, I have no peer.
###### 19
> “I have not spoken in secret,
> “In some hidden place.
> “I did not tell Jacob’s descendants,
> ‘Seek me in vain!’
> “I am the LORD,
> “The one who speaks honestly,
> “Who makes reliable announcements.
###### ¶ 20
> “Gather together and come!
> “Approach together, you refugees from the nations.
> “Those who carry wooden idols know nothing,
> “Those who pray to a god that cannot deliver.
###### 21
> “Tell me! Present the evidence!
> “Let them consult with one another.
> “Who predicted this in the past?
> “Who announced it beforehand?
> “Was it not I, the LORD?
> “I have no peer, there is no God but me,
> “A God who vindicates and delivers;
> “There is none but me.
###### 22
> “Turn to me so you can be delivered,
> “All you who live in the earth’s remote regions!
> “For I am God, and I have no peer.
###### 23
> “I solemnly make this oath—
> “What I say is true and reliable:
> ‘Surely every knee will bow to me,
> ‘Every tongue will solemnly affirm;
###### 24
> ‘They will say about me,
> “Yes, the LORD is a powerful deliverer.”’”
> All who are angry at him will cower before him.
###### 25
> All the descendants of Israel will be vindicated by the LORD
> And will boast in him.
