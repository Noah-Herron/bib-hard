# Job 35
## Elihu’s Third Speech
###### ¶ 1
Then Elihu answered:
###### 2
>  “ Do you think this to be just
>  “ When you say, ‘My right before God’?
###### 3
>  “ But you say, ‘What will it profit you,’
>  “ And, ‘What do I gain by not sinning?’
###### 4
>  “ I will reply to you,
>  “ And to your friends with you.
###### 5
>  “ Gaze at the heavens and see;
>  “ Consider the clouds, which are higher than you.
###### 6
>  “ If you sin, how does it affect God?
>  “ If your transgressions are many,
>  “ What does it do to him?
###### 7
>  “ If you are righteous, what do you give to God,
>  “ Or what does he receive from your hand?
###### 8
>  “ Your wickedness affects only a person like yourself,
>  “ And your righteousness only other people.
###### ¶ 9
>  “ People cry out
>  “ Because of the excess of oppression;
>  “ They cry out for help
>  “ Because of the power of the mighty.
###### 10
>  “ But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Creator,
>  ‘ Who gives songs in the night,
###### 11
>  ‘ Who teaches us more than the wild animals of the earth,
>  ‘ And makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
###### 12
>  “ Then they cry out—but he does not answer—
>  “ Because of the arrogance of the wicked.
###### 13
>  “ Surely it is an empty cry—God does not hear it;
>  “ The Almighty does not take notice of it.
###### 14
>  “ How much less, then,
>  “ When you say that you do not perceive him,
>  “ That the case is before him
>  “ And you are waiting for him!
###### 15
>  “ And further, when you say
>  “ That his anger does not punish,
>  “ And that he does not know transgression!
###### 16
>  “ So Job opens his mouth to no purpose;
>  “ Without knowledge he multiplies words.”
