# Proverbs 22
###### ¶ 1
> A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth,
> Good favor more than silver or gold.
###### 2
> The rich and the poor are met together;
> The LORD is the Creator of them both.
###### 3
> A shrewd person saw danger and hid himself,
> But the naive passed on by and paid for it.
###### 4
> The reward for humility and fearing the LORD
> Is riches and honor and life.
###### 5
> Thorns and snares are in the path of the perverse,
> But the one who guards himself keeps far from them.
###### 6
> Train a child in the way that he should go,
> And when he is old he will not turn from it.
###### 7
> The rich rule over the poor,
> And the borrower is servant to the lender.
###### 8
> The one who sows iniquity will reap trouble,
> And the rod of his fury will end.
###### 9
> A generous person will be blessed,
> For he has given some of his food to the poor.
###### 10
> Drive out the scorner and contention will leave;
> Strife and insults will cease.
###### 11
> The one who loves a pure heart
> And whose speech is gracious—the king will be his friend.
###### 12
> The eyes of the LORD watched over a cause,
> And subverted the words of the treacherous person.
###### 13
> The sluggard has said, “There is a lion outside!
>  “ I will be killed in the middle of the streets!”
###### 14
> The mouth of an adulteress is like a deep pit;
> The one against whom the LORD is angry will fall into it.
###### 15
> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
> But the rod of discipline will drive it far from him.
###### 16
> The one who oppresses the poor to increase his own gain
> And the one who gives to the rich—both end up only in poverty.
