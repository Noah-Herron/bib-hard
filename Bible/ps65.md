# Psalm 65
###### ¶ 1
> Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion.
> Vows made to you are fulfilled.
###### 2
> You hear prayers;
> All people approach you.
###### 3
> Our record of sins overwhelms me,
> But you forgive our acts of rebellion.
###### 4
> How blessed is the one whom you choose,
> And allow to live in your palace courts.
> May we be satisfied with the good things of your house—
> Your holy palace.
###### ¶ 5
> You answer our prayers by performing awesome acts of deliverance,
> O God, our savior.
> All the ends of the earth trust in you,
> As well as those living across the wide seas.
###### 6
> You created the mountains by your power,
> And demonstrated your strength.
###### 7
> You calmed the raging seas
> And their roaring waves,
> As well as the commotion made by the nations.
###### 8

> You cause those living in the east and west to praise you.
###### ¶ 9
> You visit the earth and give it rain;
> You make it rich and fertile.
> God’s streams are full of water;
> You provide grain for the people of the earth,
> For you have prepared the earth in this way.
###### 10
> You saturate its furrows,
> And soak its plowed ground.
> With rain showers you soften its soil,
> And make its crops grow.
###### 11
> You crown the year with your good blessings,
> And you leave abundance in your wake.
###### 12
> The pastures in the wilderness glisten with moisture,
> And the hills are clothed with joy.
###### 13
> The meadows are clothed with sheep,
> And the valleys are covered with grain.
> They shout joyfully, yes, they sing.
