# Ecclesiastes 2
## Futility of Self-Indulgent Pleasure
###### ¶ 1
I thought to myself,
>  “ Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile.”
> But I found that it also is futile.
###### 2
> I said of partying, “It is folly,”
> And of self-indulgent pleasure, “It accomplishes nothing!”
###### 3
> I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine
> (all the while my mind was guiding me with wisdom)
> And the effects of behaving foolishly,
> So that I might discover what is profitable
> For people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.
## Futility of Materialism
###### 4
> I increased my possessions:
> I built houses for myself;
> I planted vineyards for myself.
###### 5
> I designed royal gardens and parks for myself,
> And I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
###### 6
> I constructed pools of water for myself,
> To irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.
###### 7
> I purchased male and female slaves,
> And I owned slaves who were born in my house;
> I also possessed more livestock—both herds and flocks—
> Than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.
###### 8
> I also amassed silver and gold for myself,
> As well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces.
> I acquired male singers and female singers for myself,
> And what gives a man sensual delight—a harem of beautiful concubines.
###### ¶ 9
> So I was far wealthier than all my predecessors in Jerusalem,
> Yet I maintained my objectivity.
###### 10
> I did not restrain myself from getting whatever I wanted;
> I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure.
> So all my accomplishments gave me joy;
> This was my reward for all my effort.
###### 11
> Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished
> And on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it,
> I concluded: “All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless—
>  “ Like chasing the wind!
>  “ There is nothing gained from them on earth.”
## Wisdom is Better than Folly
###### ¶ 12
> Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas.
> For what more can the king’s successor do than what the king has already done?
###### 13
> I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly,
> Just as light is preferable to darkness:
###### 14
> The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness.
> Yet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.
###### 15
> So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me!
>  “ Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?”
> So I lamented to myself,
>  “ The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!”
###### 16
> For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long,
> Because in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten.
> Alas, the wise man dies—just like the fool!
###### 17
> So I loathed life because what
> Happens on earth seems awful to me;
> For all the benefits of wisdom are futile—like chasing the wind.
## Futility of Being a Workaholic
###### ¶ 18
> So I loathed all the fruit of my effort,
> For which I worked so hard on earth,
> Because I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.
###### 19
> Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?
> Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor
> For which I worked so wisely on earth.
> This also is futile!
###### 20
> So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor
> For which I worked so hard on earth.
###### 21
> For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;
> However, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance
> To someone else who did not work for it.
> This also is futile, and an awful injustice!
## Painful Days and Restless Nights
###### 22
> What does a man acquire from all his labor
> And from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?
###### 23
> For all day long his work produces pain and frustration,
> And even at night his mind cannot relax.
> This also is futile!
## Enjoy Work and its Benefits
###### ¶ 24
> There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink,
> And to find enjoyment in their work.
> I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.
###### 25
> For no one can eat and drink
> Or experience joy apart from him.
###### 26
> For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy,
> But to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth—
> Only to give it to the one who pleases God.
> This task of the wicked is futile—like chasing the wind!
