# Psalm 42
## Book 2 (Psalms 42-72)
###### ¶ 1
> As a deer longs for streams of water,
> So I long for you, O God!
###### 2
> I thirst for God,
> For the living God.
> I say, “When will I be able to go and appear in God’s presence?”
###### 3
> I cannot eat; I weep day and night.
> All day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”
###### 4
> I will remember and weep.
> For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God,
> Shouting and giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival.
###### ¶ 5
> Why are you depressed, O my soul?
> Why are you upset?
> Wait for God!
> For I will again give thanks
> To my God for his saving intervention.
###### 6
> I am depressed,
> So I will pray to you while in the region of the upper Jordan,
> From Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
###### 7
> One deep stream calls out to another at the sound of your waterfalls;
> All your billows and waves overwhelm me.
###### 8
> By day the LORD decrees his loyal love,
> And by night he gives me a song,
> A prayer to the God of my life.
###### ¶ 9
> I will pray to God, my high ridge:
>  “ Why do you ignore me?
>  “ Why must I walk around mourning
>  “ Because my enemies oppress me?”
###### 10
> My enemies’ taunts cut me to the bone,
> As they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
###### 11
> Why are you depressed, O my soul?
> Why are you upset?
> Wait for God!
> For I will again give thanks
> To my God for his saving intervention.
