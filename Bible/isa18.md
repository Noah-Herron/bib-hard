# Isaiah 18
## The Lord Will Judge a Distant Land in the South
###### ¶ 1
> Beware, land of buzzing wings,
> The one beyond the rivers of Cush,
###### 2
> That sends messengers by sea,
> Who glide over the water’s surface in boats made of papyrus.
> Go, you swift messengers,
> To a nation of tall, smooth-skinned people,
> To a people that are feared far and wide,
> To a nation strong and victorious,
> Whose land rivers divide.
###### 3
> All you who live in the world,
> Who reside on the earth,
> You will see a signal flag raised on the mountains;
> You will hear a trumpet being blown.
###### 4
> For this is what the LORD has told me:
> “I will wait and watch from my place,
> “Like scorching heat produced by the sunlight,
> “Like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest.”
###### 5
> For before the harvest, when the bud has sprouted,
> And the ripening fruit appears,
> He will cut off the unproductive shoots with pruning knives;
> He will prune the tendrils.
###### 6
> They will all be left for the birds of the hills
> And the wild animals;
> The birds will eat them during the summer,
> And all the wild animals will eat them during the winter.
###### 7
> At that time
> Tribute will be brought to the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> By a people that are tall and smooth-skinned,
> A people that are feared far and wide,
> A nation strong and victorious,
> Whose land rivers divide.
> The tribute will be brought to the place where the LORD of Heaven’s Armies has chosen to reside, on Mount Zion.
