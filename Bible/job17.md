# Job 17
###### ¶ 1
> My spirit is broken,
> My days have faded out,
> The grave awaits me.
###### 2
> Surely mockery is with me;
> My eyes must dwell on their hostility.
###### ¶ 3
> Set my pledge beside you.
> Who else will put up security for me?
###### 4
> Because you have closed their minds to understanding,
> Therefore you will not exalt them.
###### 5
> If a man denounces his friends for personal gain,
> The eyes of his children will fail.
###### ¶ 6
> He has made me a byword to people,
> I am the one in whose face they spit.
###### 7
> My eyes have grown dim with grief;
> My whole frame is but a shadow.
###### 8
> Upright men are appalled at this;
> The innocent man is troubled with the godless.
###### 9
> But the righteous man holds to his way,
> And the one with clean hands grows stronger.
## Anticipation of Death
###### 10
>  “ But turn, all of you, and come now!
>  “ I will not find a wise man among you.
###### 11
>  “ My days have passed, my plans are shattered,
>  “ Even the desires of my heart.
###### 12
>  “ These men change night into day;
>  “ They say, ‘The light is near
>  ‘ In the face of darkness.’
###### 13
>  “ If I hope for the grave to be my home,
>  “ If I spread out my bed in darkness,
###### 14
>  “ If I cry out to corruption, ‘You are my father,’
>  “ And to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’
###### 15
>  “ Where then is my hope?
>  “ And my hope, who sees it?
###### 16
>  “ Will it go down to the barred gates of death?
>  “ Will we descend together into the dust?”
