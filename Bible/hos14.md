## Prophetic Call to Genuine Repentance
###### ¶ 1
> Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God,
> For your sin has been your downfall!
###### 2
> Return to the LORD and repent!
> Say to him: “Completely forgive our iniquity;
>  “ Accept our penitential prayer,
>  “ That we may offer the praise of our lips as sacrificial bulls.
###### 3
>  “ Assyria cannot save us;
>  “ We will not ride warhorses.
>  “ We will never again say, ‘Our gods,’
>  “ To what our own hands have made.
>  “ For only you will show compassion to Orphan Israel!”

## Concluding Exhortation
###### ¶ 9

> But in them the rebellious stumble.
