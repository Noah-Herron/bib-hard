# Job 11
## Zophar’s First Speech to Job
###### ¶ 1
Then Zophar the Naamathite spoke up and said:
###### 2
>  “ Should not this abundance of words be answered,
>  “ Or should this talkative man
>  “ Be vindicated?
###### 3
>  “ Should people remain silent at your idle talk,
>  “ And should no one rebuke you when you mock?
###### 4
>  “ For you have said, ‘My teaching is flawless,
>  ‘ And I am pure in your sight.’
###### 5
>  “ But if only God would speak,
>  “ If only he would open his lips against you,
###### 6
>  “ And reveal to you the secrets of wisdom—
>  “ For true wisdom has two sides—
>  “ So that you would know
>  “ That God has forgiven some of your sins.
###### ¶ 7
>  “ Can you discover the essence of God?
>  “ Can you find out the perfection of the Almighty?
###### 8
>  “ It is higher than the heavens—what can you do?
>  “ It is deeper than Sheol—what can you know?
###### 9
>  “ Its measure is longer than the earth,
>  “ And broader than the sea.
###### 10
>  “ If he comes by and confines you
>  “ And convenes a court,
>  “ Then who can prevent him?
###### 11
>  “ For he knows deceitful men;
>  “ When he sees evil, will he not consider it?
###### 12
>  “ But an empty man will become wise,
>  “ When a wild donkey’s colt is born a human being.
###### ¶ 13
>  “ As for you, if you prove faithful,
>  “ And if you stretch out your hands toward him,
###### 14
>  “ If iniquity is in your hand—put it far away,
>  “ And do not let evil reside in your tents.
###### 15
>  “ For then you will lift up your face
>  “ Without blemish;
>  “ You will be securely established
>  “ And will not fear.
###### 16
>  “ For you will forget your trouble;
>  “ You will remember it
>  “ Like water that has flowed away.
###### 17
>  “ And life will be brighter than the noonday;
>  “ Though there be darkness,
>  “ It will be like the morning.
###### 18
>  “ And you will be secure, because there is hope;
>  “ You will be protected
>  “ And will take your rest in safety.
###### 19
>  “ You will lie down with no one to make you afraid,
>  “ And many will seek your favor.
###### 20
>  “ But the eyes of the wicked fail,
>  “ And escape eludes them;
>  “ Their one hope is to breathe their last.”
