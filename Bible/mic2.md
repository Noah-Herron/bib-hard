# Micah 2
## Land Robbers Will Lose Their Land
###### ¶ 1
> Beware wicked schemers,
> Those who devise calamity as they lie in bed.
> As soon as morning dawns they carry out their plans,
> Because they have the power to do so.
###### 2
> They confiscate the fields they desire
> And seize the houses they want.
> They defraud people of their homes
> And deprive people of the land they have inherited.
###### 3
Therefore the LORD says this:
> “Look, I am devising disaster for this nation!
> “It will be like a yoke from which you cannot free your neck.
> “You will no longer walk proudly,
> “For it will be a time of catastrophe.
###### 4
> “In that day people will sing this taunt song to you—
> “They will mock you with this lament:
> ‘We are completely destroyed;
> ‘They sell off the property of my people.
> ‘How they remove it from me!
> ‘They assign our fields to the conqueror.’”
###### 5
> Therefore no one will assign you land in the LORD’s community.
###### ¶ 6
> “Don’t preach with such impassioned rhetoric,” they say excitedly.
> “These prophets should not preach of such things;
> “We will not be overtaken by humiliation.”
###### 7
> Does the family of Jacob say,
> “The LORD’s patience can’t be exhausted—
> “He would never do such things”?
> To be sure, my commands bring a reward
> For those who obey them,
###### 8
> But you rise up as an enemy against my people.
> You steal a robe from a friend,
> From those who pass by peacefully as if returning from a war.
###### 9
> You wrongly evict widows among my people from their cherished homes.
> You defraud their children of their prized inheritance.
###### 10
> But you are the ones who will be forced to leave!
> For this land is not secure;
> Sin will thoroughly destroy it!
###### 11
> If a lying windbag should come and say,
> ‘I’ll promise you blessings of wine and beer,’
> “He would be just the right preacher for these people!”
## The Lord Will Restore His People
###### ¶ 12
> “I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob,
> “I will certainly assemble those Israelites who remain.
> “I will bring them together like sheep in a fold,
> “Like a flock in the middle of a pasture;
> “They will be so numerous that they will make a lot of noise.
###### 13
> “The one who can break through barriers will lead them out;
> “They will break out, pass through the gate, and leave.
> “Their king will advance before them;
> “The LORD himself will lead them.”
