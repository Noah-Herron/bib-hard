## God Will Judge Israel
###### ¶ 6
This is what the LORD says:
>  “ Because Israel has committed three covenant transgressions—
>  “ Make that four—I will not revoke my decree of judgment.
>  “ They sold the innocent for silver,
>  “ The needy for a pair of sandals.
###### 7
>  “ They trample on the dirt-covered heads of the poor;
>  “ They push the destitute away.
>  “ A man and his father go to the same girl;
>  “ In this way they show disrespect for my moral purity.
###### 8
>  “ They stretch out on clothing seized as collateral;
>  “ They do so right beside every altar!
>  “ They drink wine bought with the fines they have levied;
>  “ They do so right in the temple of their God!
###### ¶ 9
>  “ For Israel’s sake I destroyed the Amorites.
>  “ They were as tall as cedars
>  “ And as strong as oaks,
>  “ But I destroyed the fruit on their branches
>  “ And their roots in the ground.
###### 10

>  “ I led you through the wilderness for forty years
>  “ So you could take the Amorites’ land as your own.
###### 11

>  “ And some of your young men Nazirites.

###### 12

>  “ You commanded the prophets, ‘Do not prophesy!’
###### 13
>  “ Look! I will press you down,
>  “ Like a cart loaded down with grain presses down.
###### 14
>  “ Fast runners will find no place to hide;
>  “ Strong men will have no strength left;
>  “ Warriors will not be able to save their lives.
###### 15
>  “ Archers will not hold their ground;
>  “ Fast runners will not save their lives,
>  “ Nor will those who ride horses.
###### 16
>  “ Bravehearted warriors will run away naked in that day.”
> The LORD is speaking.
