# Psalm 14
###### ¶ 1
> Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.”
> They sin and commit evil deeds;
> None of them does what is right.
###### 2
> The LORD looks down from heaven at the human race,
> To see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.
###### 3
> Everyone rejects God;
> They are all morally corrupt.
> None of them does what is right,
> Not even one.
###### ¶ 4
> All those who behave wickedly do not understand—
> Those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,
> And do not call out to the LORD.
###### 5
> They are absolutely terrified,
> For God defends the godly.
###### 6
> You want to humiliate the oppressed,
> Even though the LORD is their shelter.
###### ¶ 7
> I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!
> When the LORD restores the well-being of his people,
> May Jacob rejoice,
> May Israel be happy!
