# Zephaniah 2
## The Prophet Warns the People
###### ¶ 1
> Bunch yourselves together like straw, you undesirable nation,
###### 2
> Before God’s decree becomes reality and the day of opportunity disappears like windblown chaff,
> Before the LORD’s raging anger overtakes you—
> Before the day of the LORD’s angry judgment overtakes you!
###### 3
> Seek the LORD’s favor, all you humble people of the land who have obeyed his commands!
> Strive to do what is right! Strive to be humble!
> Maybe you will be protected on the day of the LORD’s angry judgment.
## Judgment on Surrounding Nations
###### ¶ 4
> Indeed, Gaza will be deserted
> And Ashkelon will become a heap of ruins.
> Invaders will drive away the people of Ashdod by noon,
> And Ekron will be overthrown.
###### 5
> Beware, you who live by the sea, the people who came from Crete.
> The Lord’s message is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines:
>  “ I will destroy everyone who lives there!”
###### 6
> The seacoast will be used as pasture lands by the shepherds
> And as pens for their flocks.
###### 7
> Those who are left from the kingdom of Judah will take possession of it.
> By the sea they will graze,
> In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening,
> For the LORD their God will intervene for them and restore their prosperity.
###### ¶ 8
>  “ I have heard Moab’s taunts
>  “ And the Ammonites’ insults.
>  “ They taunted my people
>  “ And verbally harassed those living in Judah.
###### 9
>  “ Therefore, as surely as I live,” says the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,
>  “ Be certain that Moab will become like Sodom
>  “ And the Ammonites like Gomorrah.
>  “ They will be overrun by weeds,
>  “ Filled with salt pits,
>  “ And permanently desolate.
>  “ Those of my people who are left will plunder their belongings;
>  “ Those who are left in Judah will take possession of their land.”
###### 10
> This is how they will be repaid for their arrogance,
> For they taunted and verbally harassed the people of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 11
> The LORD will terrify them,
> For he will weaken all the gods of the earth.
> All the distant nations will worship the LORD in their own lands.
###### ¶ 12
>  “ You Ethiopians will also die by my sword!”
###### 13
> The LORD will attack the north
> And destroy Assyria.
> He will make Nineveh a heap of ruins;
> It will be as barren as the desert.
###### 14
> Flocks and herds will lie down in the middle of it,
> As well as every kind of wild animal.
> Owls will sleep in the tops of its support pillars;
> They will hoot through the windows.
> Rubble will cover the thresholds;
> Even the cedar work will be exposed to the elements.
###### 15
> This is how the once-proud city will end up—
> The city that was so secure.
> She thought to herself, “I am unique! No one can compare to me!”
> What a heap of ruins she has become, a place where wild animals live!
> Everyone who passes by her taunts her and shakes his fist.
