# Amos 9
###### ¶ 1
I saw the Lord standing by the altar and he said,
>  “ Strike the tops of the support pillars, so the thresholds shake!
>  “ Knock them down on the heads of all the people,
>  “ And I will kill the survivors with the sword.
>  “ No one will be able to run away;
>  “ No one will be able to escape.
###### 2
>  “ Even if they could dig down into the netherworld,
>  “ My hand would pull them up from there.
>  “ Even if they could climb up to heaven,
>  “ I would drag them down from there.
###### 3
>  “ Even if they were to hide on the top of Mount Carmel,
>  “ I would hunt them down and take them from there.
>  “ Even if they tried to hide from me at the bottom of the sea,
>  “ From there I would command the Sea Serpent to bite them.
###### 4
>  “ Even when their enemies drive them into captivity,
>  “ From there I will command the sword to kill them.
>  “ I will not let them out of my sight;
>  “ They will experience disaster, not prosperity.”
###### ¶ 5
> The Sovereign LORD of Heaven’s Armies will do this.
> He touches the earth and it dissolves;
> All who live on it mourn.
> The whole earth rises like the Nile River,
> And then grows calm like the Nile in Egypt.
###### 6
> He builds the upper rooms of his palace in heaven
> And sets its foundation supports on the earth.
> He summons the water of the sea
> And pours it out on the earth’s surface.
> The LORD is his name.
###### ¶ 7
>  “ You Israelites are just like the Ethiopians in my sight,” says the LORD.
>  “ Certainly I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt,
>  “ But I also brought the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir.
###### 8
>  “ Look, the Sovereign LORD is watching the sinful nation,
>  “ And I will destroy it from the face of the earth.
>  “ But I will not completely destroy the family of Jacob,” says the LORD.
###### 9
>  “ For look, I am giving a command
>  “ And I will shake the family of Israel together with all the nations.
>  “ It will resemble a sieve being shaken,
>  “ When not even a pebble falls to the ground.
###### 10
>  “ All the sinners among my people will die by the sword—
>  “ The ones who say, ‘Disaster will not come near, it will not confront us.’”
## The Restoration of the Davidic Dynasty
###### ¶ 11
>  “ In that day I will rebuild the collapsing hut of David.
>  “ I will seal its gaps,
>  “ Repair its ruins,
>  “ And restore it to what it was like in days gone by.
###### 12
>  “ As a result they will conquer those left in Edom
>  “ And all the nations subject to my rule.”
> The LORD, who is about to do this, is speaking.
###### ¶ 13
>  “ Be sure of this, the time is coming,” says the LORD,
>  “ When the plowman will catch up to the reaper,
>  “ And the one who stomps the grapes will overtake the planter.
>  “ Juice will run down the slopes;
>  “ It will flow down all the hillsides.
###### 14
>  “ I will bring back my people, Israel;
>  “ They will rebuild the cities lying in rubble and settle down.
>  “ They will plant vineyards and drink the wine they produce;
>  “ They will grow orchards and eat the fruit they produce.
###### 15
>  “ I will plant them on their land,
>  “ And they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them,”
> Says the LORD your God.
