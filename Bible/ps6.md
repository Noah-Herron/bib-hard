# Psalm 6
###### ¶ 1
> LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger.
> Do not discipline me in your raging fury.
###### 2
> Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am frail.
> Heal me, LORD, for my bones are shaking.
###### 3
> I am absolutely terrified,
> And you, LORD—how long will this continue?
###### ¶ 4
> Relent, LORD, rescue me!
> Deliver me because of your faithfulness.
###### 5
> For no one remembers you in the realm of death.
> In Sheol who gives you thanks?
###### ¶ 6
> I am exhausted as I groan.
> All night long I drench my bed in tears;
> My tears saturate the cushion beneath me.
###### 7
> My eyes grow dim from suffering;
> They grow weak because of all my enemies.
###### ¶ 8

> For the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.
###### 9
> The LORD has heard my appeal for mercy;
> The LORD has accepted my prayer.
###### 10
> They will be humiliated and absolutely terrified.
> All my enemies will turn back and be suddenly humiliated.
