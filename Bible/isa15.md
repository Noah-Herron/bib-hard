# Isaiah 15
## The Lord Will Judge Moab
###### ¶ 1
> This is an oracle about Moab:
> Indeed, in a night it is devastated,
> Ar of Moab is destroyed!
> Indeed, in a night it is devastated,
> Kir of Moab is destroyed!
###### 2
> They went up to the temple;
> The people of Dibon went up to the high places to lament.
> Because of what happened to Nebo and Medeba, Moab wails.
> Every head is shaved bare,
> Every beard is trimmed off.
###### 3
> In their streets they wear sackcloth;
> On their roofs and in their town squares
> All of them wail;
> They fall down weeping.
###### 4
> The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;
> Their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz.
> For this reason Moab’s soldiers shout in distress;
> Their courage wavers.
###### 5
> My heart cries out because of Moab’s plight,
> And for the fugitives stretched out as far as Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah.
> For they weep as they make their way up the ascent of Luhith;
> They loudly lament their demise on the road to Horonaim.
###### 6
> For the waters of Nimrim are gone;
> The grass is dried up,
> The vegetation has disappeared,
> And there are no plants.
###### 7
> For this reason what they have made and stored up,
> They carry over the Stream of the Poplars.
###### 8
> Indeed, the cries of distress echo throughout Moabite territory;
> Their wailing can be heard in Eglaim and Beer Elim.
###### 9
> Indeed, the waters of Dimon are full of blood!
> Indeed, I will heap even more trouble on Dimon.
> A lion will attack the Moabite fugitives
> And the people left in the land.
