# Hosea 4
## The Lord’s Covenant Lawsuit against the Nation Israel
###### ¶ 1
> Listen to the LORD’s message, you Israelites!
> For the LORD has a covenant lawsuit against the people of Israel.
> For there is neither faithfulness nor loyalty in the land,
> Nor do they acknowledge God.
###### 2
> There is only cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery.
> They resort to violence and bloodshed.
###### 3
> Therefore the land will mourn,
> And all its inhabitants will perish.
> The wild animals, the birds of the sky,
> And even the fish in the sea will perish.
## The Lord’s Dispute against the Sinful Priesthood
###### ¶ 4
> Do not let anyone accuse or contend against anyone else:
> For my case is against you priests!
###### 5
> You stumble day and night,
> And the false prophets stumble with you;
> You have destroyed your own people.
###### 6
> You have destroyed my people
> By failing to acknowledge me!
> Because you refuse to acknowledge me,
> I will reject you as my priests.
> Because you reject the law of your God,
> I will reject your descendants.
###### ¶ 7
> The more the priests increased in numbers,
> The more they rebelled against me.
> They have turned their glorious calling
> Into a shameful disgrace!
###### 8
> They feed on the sin offerings of my people;
> Their appetites long for their iniquity!
###### 9
> I will deal with the people and priests together:
> I will punish them both for their ways,
> And I will repay them for their deeds.
###### 10
> They will eat, but not be satisfied;
> They will engage in prostitution, but not increase in numbers;
> Because they have abandoned the LORD
> By pursuing other gods.
## Judgment of Pagan Idolatry and Cultic Prostitution
###### ¶ 11
> Old and new wine
> Take away the understanding of my people.
###### 12
> They consult their wooden idols,
> And their diviner’s staff answers with an oracle.
> The wind of prostitution blows them astray;
> They commit spiritual adultery against their God.
###### 13
> They sacrifice on the mountaintops
> And burn offerings on the hills;
> They sacrifice under oak, poplar, and terebinth,
> Because their shade is so pleasant.
> As a result, your daughters have become cult prostitutes,
> And your daughters-in-law commit adultery!
###### 14
> I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution,
> Nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.
> For the men consort with harlots,
> They sacrifice with temple prostitutes.
> It is true: “A people that lacks understanding will come to ruin!”
## Warning to Judah: Do Not Join in Israel’s Apostasy
###### ¶ 15
> Although you, O Israel, commit adultery,
> Do not let Judah become guilty!
> Do not journey to Gilgal.
> Do not go up to Beth Aven.
> Do not swear, “As surely as the LORD lives!”
###### 16
> Israel has rebelled like a stubborn heifer!
> Soon the LORD will put them out to pasture
> Like a lamb in a broad field.
###### 17
> Ephraim has attached himself to idols;
> Do not go near him!
## The Shameful Sinners Will Be Brought to Shame
###### 18
> They consume their alcohol,
> Then engage in cult prostitution;
> They dearly love their shameful behavior.
###### 19
> A whirlwind has wrapped them in its wings;
> They will be brought to shame because of their idolatrous worship.
