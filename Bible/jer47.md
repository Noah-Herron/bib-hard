# Jeremiah 47
## Judgment on the Philistine Cities
###### ¶ 1
This was the Lord’s message to the prophet Jeremiah about the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
###### 2
>  “ Look! Enemies are gathering in the north like water rising in a river.
>  “ They will be like an overflowing stream.
>  “ They will overwhelm the whole country and everything in it like a flood.
>  “ They will overwhelm the cities and their inhabitants.
>  “ People will cry out in alarm.
>  “ Everyone living in the country will cry out in pain.
###### 3
>  “ Fathers will hear the hoofbeats of the enemies’ horses,
>  “ The clatter of their chariots and the rumbling of their wheels.
>  “ They will not turn back to save their children
>  “ Because they will be paralyzed with fear.
###### 4
>  “ For the time has come
>  “ To destroy all the Philistines.
>  “ The time has come to destroy all the help
>  “ That remains for Tyre and Sidon.
>  “ For I, the LORD, will destroy the Philistines,
>  “ That remnant that came from the island of Crete.
###### 5
>  “ The people of Gaza will shave their heads in mourning.
>  “ The people of Ashkelon will be struck dumb.
>  “ How long will you gash yourselves to show your sorrow,
>  “ You who remain of Philistia’s power?
###### 6
>  “ How long will you cry out, ‘Oh, sword of the LORD,
>  ‘ How long will it be before you stop killing?
>  ‘ Go back into your sheath;
>  ‘ Stay there and rest!’
###### 7
>  “ But how can it rest
>  “ When I, the LORD, have given it orders?
>  “ I have ordered it to attack
>  “ The people of Ashkelon and the seacoast.”
