# Isaiah 49
## Delivery of the Exiles
###### ¶ 1
> Listen to me, you coastlands!
> Pay attention, you people who live far away!
> The LORD summoned me from birth;
> He commissioned me when my mother brought me into the world.
###### 2
> He made my mouth like a sharp sword,
> He hid me in the hollow of his hand;
> He made me like a sharpened arrow,
> He hid me in his quiver.
###### 3
> He said to me, “You are my servant,
> “Israel, through whom I will reveal my splendor.”
###### 4
> But I thought, “I have worked in vain;
> “I have expended my energy for absolutely nothing.”
> But the LORD will vindicate me;
> My God will reward me.
###### ¶ 5
> So now the LORD says,
> The one who formed me from birth to be his servant—
> He did this to restore Jacob to himself,
> So that Israel might be gathered to him;
> And I will be honored in the LORD’s sight,
> For my God is my source of strength—
###### 6
> He says, “Is it too insignificant a task for you to be my servant,
> “To reestablish the tribes of Jacob,
> “And restore the remnant of Israel?
> “I will make you a light to the nations,
> “So you can bring my deliverance to the remote regions of the earth.”
###### 7
> This is what the LORD,
> The Protector of Israel, their Holy One, says
> To the one who is despised and rejected by nations,
> A servant of rulers:
> “Kings will see and rise in respect,
> “Princes will bow down,
> “Because of the faithful LORD,
> “The Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.”
###### ¶ 8
This is what the LORD says:
> “At the time I decide to show my favor, I will respond to you;
> “In the day of deliverance I will help you;
> “I will protect you and make you a covenant mediator for people,
> “To rebuild the land
> “And to reassign the desolate property.
###### 9
> “You will say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’
> “And to those who are in dark dungeons, ‘Emerge.’
> “They will graze beside the roads;
> “On all the slopes they will find pasture.
###### 10
> “They will not be hungry or thirsty;
> “The sun’s oppressive heat will not beat down on them,
> “For one who has compassion on them will guide them;
> “He will lead them to springs of water.
###### 11
> “I will make all my mountains into a road;
> “I will construct my roadways.”
###### 12
> Look, they come from far away!
> Look, some come from the north and west,
> And others from the land of Sinim.
###### 13
> Shout for joy, O sky!
> Rejoice, O earth!
> Let the mountains give a joyful shout!
> For the LORD consoles his people
> And shows compassion to the oppressed.
## The Lord Remembers Zion
###### ¶ 14
> “Zion said, ‘The LORD has abandoned me,
> ‘The Lord has forgotten me.’
###### 15
> “Can a woman forget her baby who nurses at her breast?
> “Can she withhold compassion from the child she has borne?
> “Even if mothers were to forget,
> “I could never forget you!
###### 16
> “Look, I have inscribed your name on my palms;
> “Your walls are constantly before me.
###### 17
> “Your children hurry back,
> “While those who destroyed and devastated you depart.
###### 18
> “Look all around you!
> “All of them gather to you.
> “As surely as I live,” says the LORD,
> “You will certainly wear all of them like jewelry;
> “You will put them on as if you were a bride.
###### 19
> “Yes, your land lies in ruins;
> “It is desolate and devastated.
> “But now you will be too small to hold your residents,
> “And those who devoured you will be far away.
###### 20
> “Yet the children born during your time of bereavement
> “Will say within your hearing,
> ‘This place is too cramped for us,
> ‘Make room for us so we can live here.’
###### 21
> “Then you will think to yourself,
> ‘Who bore these children for me?
> ‘I was bereaved and barren,
> ‘Dismissed and divorced.
> ‘Who raised these children?
> ‘Look, I was left all alone;
> ‘Where did these children come from?’”
###### ¶ 22
This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
> “Look I will raise my hand to the nations;
> “I will raise my signal flag to the peoples.
> “They will bring your sons in their arms
> “And carry your daughters on their shoulders.
###### 23
> “Kings will be your children’s guardians;
> “Their princesses will nurse your children.
> “With their faces to the ground they will bow down to you,
> “And they will lick the dirt on your feet.
> “Then you will recognize that I am the LORD;
> “Those who wait patiently for me are not put to shame.
###### ¶ 24
> “Can spoils be taken from a warrior,
> “Or captives be rescued from a conqueror?
###### 25
> “Indeed,” says the LORD,
> “Captives will be taken from a warrior;
> “Spoils will be rescued from a conqueror.
> “I will oppose your adversary
> “And I will rescue your children.
###### 26
> “I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh;
> “They will get drunk on their own blood, as if it were wine.
> “Then all humankind will recognize that
> “I am the LORD, your Deliverer,
> “Your Protector, the Powerful One of Jacob.”
