# Isaiah 3
## A Coming Leadership Crisis
###### ¶ 1
> Look, the Sovereign LORD of Heaven’s Armies
> Is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah
> Every source of security, including
> All the food and water,
###### 2
> The mighty men and warriors,
> Judges and prophets,
> Omen readers and leaders,
###### 3
> Captains of groups of fifty,
> The respected citizens,
> Advisers and those skilled in magical arts,
> And those who know incantations.
###### 4
> The LORD says, “I will make youths their officials;
> “Malicious young men will rule over them.
###### 5
> “The people will treat each other harshly;
> “Men will oppose each other;
> “Neighbors will fight.
> “Youths will proudly defy the elderly
> “And riffraff will challenge those who were once respected.
###### 6
> “Indeed, a man will grab his brother
> “Right in his father’s house and say,
> ‘You own a coat—
> ‘You be our leader!
> ‘This heap of ruins will be under your control.’
###### 7
> “At that time the brother will shout,
> ‘I am no doctor,
> ‘I have no food or coat in my house;
> ‘Don’t make me a leader of the people!’”
###### 8
> Jerusalem certainly stumbles,
> Judah falls,
> For their words and their actions offend the LORD;
> They rebel against his royal authority.
###### 9
> The look on their faces testifies to their guilt;
> Like the people of Sodom they openly boast of their sin.
> Woe to them!
> For they bring disaster on themselves.
###### 10
> Tell the innocent it will go well with them,
> For they will be rewarded for what they have done.
###### 11
> Woe to the wicked sinners!
> For they will get exactly what they deserve.
###### 12
> Oppressors treat my people cruelly;
> Creditors rule over them.
> My people, your leaders mislead you;
> They give you confusing directions.
###### ¶ 13
> The LORD takes his position to judge;
> He stands up to pass sentence on his people.
###### 14
> The LORD comes to pronounce judgment
> On the leaders of his people and their officials.
> He says, “It is you who have ruined the vineyard!
> “You have stashed in your houses what you have stolen from the poor.
###### 15
> “Why do you crush my people
> “And grind the faces of the poor?”
> The Sovereign LORD of Heaven’s Armies has spoken.
## Washing Away Impurity
###### ¶ 16
> The LORD says,
> “The women of Zion are proud.
> “They walk with their heads high
> “And flirt with their eyes.
> “They skip along
> “And the jewelry on their ankles jingles.
###### 17
> “So the Lord will afflict the foreheads of Zion’s women with skin diseases;
> “The LORD will make the front of their heads bald.”
###### 18
At that time the Lord will remove their beautiful ankle jewelry, neck ornaments, crescent-shaped ornaments,
###### 19
earrings, bracelets, veils,
###### 20
headdresses, ankle ornaments, sashes, sachets, amulets,
###### 21
rings, nose rings,
###### 22
festive dresses, robes, shawls, purses,
###### 23
garments, vests, head coverings, and gowns.
###### 24
> A putrid stench will replace the smell of spices,
> A rope will replace a belt,
> Baldness will replace braided locks of hair,
> A sackcloth garment will replace a fine robe,
> And a prisoner’s brand will replace beauty.
###### 25
> Your men will fall by the sword,
> Your strong men will die in battle.
###### 26
> Her gates will mourn and lament;
> Deprived of her people, she will sit on the ground.
