# Job 28
## III. Job’s Search for Wisdom [28:
## 1-28]
## No Known Road to Wisdom
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Surely there is a mine for silver,
>  “ And a place where gold is refined.
###### 2
>  “ Iron is taken from the ground,
>  “ And rock is poured out as copper.
###### 3
>  “ Man puts an end to the darkness;
>  “ He searches the farthest recesses
>  “ For the ore in the deepest darkness.
###### 4
>  “ Far from where people live he sinks a shaft,
>  “ In places travelers have long forgotten,
>  “ Far from other people he dangles and sways.
###### 5
>  “ The earth, from which food comes,
>  “ Is overturned below as though by fire;
###### 6
>  “ A place whose stones are sapphires
>  “ That contain dust of gold;
###### 7
>  “ A hidden path no bird of prey knows—
>  “ No falcon’s eye has spotted it.
###### 8
>  “ Proud beasts have not set foot on it,
>  “ And no lion has passed along it.
###### 9
>  “ On the flinty rock man has set to work with his hand;
>  “ He has overturned mountains at their bases.
###### 10
>  “ He has cut out channels through the rocks;
>  “ His eyes have spotted every precious thing.
###### 11
>  “ He has searched the sources of the rivers
>  “ And what was hidden he has brought into the light.”
## No Price Can Buy Wisdom
###### ¶ 12
>  “ But wisdom—where can it be found?
>  “ Where is the place of understanding?
###### 13
>  “ Mankind does not know its place;
>  “ It cannot be found in the land of the living.
###### 14
>  “ The deep says, ‘It is not with me.’
>  “ And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
###### 15
>  “ Fine gold cannot be given in exchange for it,
>  “ Nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
###### 16
>  “ It cannot be measured out for purchase with the gold of Ophir,
>  “ With precious onyx or sapphires.
###### 17
>  “ Neither gold nor crystal can be compared with it,
>  “ Nor can a vase of gold match its worth.
###### 18
>  “ Of coral and jasper no mention will be made;
>  “ The price of wisdom is more than pearls.
###### 19
>  “ The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it;
>  “ It cannot be purchased with pure gold.”
## God Alone Has Wisdom
###### 20
>  “ But wisdom—where does it come from?
>  “ Where is the place of understanding?
###### 21
>  “ For it has been hidden
>  “ From the eyes of every living creature,
>  “ And from the birds of the sky it has been concealed.
###### 22
>  “ Destruction and Death say,
>  ‘ With our ears we have heard a rumor about where it can be found.’
###### ¶ 23
>  “ God understands the way to it,
>  “ And he alone knows its place.
###### 24
>  “ For he looks to the ends of the earth
>  “ And observes everything under the heavens.
###### 25
>  “ When he made the force of the wind
>  “ And measured the waters with a gauge,
###### 26
>  “ When he imposed a limit for the rain,
>  “ And a path for the thunderstorm,
###### 27
>  “ Then he looked at wisdom and assessed its value;
>  “ He established it and examined it closely.
###### 28
>  “ And he said to mankind,
>  ‘ The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,
>  ‘ And to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
