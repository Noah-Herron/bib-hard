# Job 9
## Job’s Reply to Bildad
###### ¶ 1
Then Job answered:
###### 2
>  “ Truly, I know that this is so.
>  “ But how can a human be just before God?
###### 3
>  “ If someone wishes to contend with him,
>  “ He cannot answer him one time in a thousand.
###### 4
>  “ He is wise in heart and mighty in strength—
>  “ Who has resisted him and remained safe?
###### 5
>  “ He who removes mountains suddenly,
>  “ Who overturns them in his anger,
###### 6
>  “ He who shakes the earth out of its place
>  “ So that its pillars tremble,
###### 7
>  “ He who commands the sun, and it does not shine
>  “ And seals up the stars,
###### 8
>  “ He alone spreads out the heavens,
>  “ And treads on the waves of the sea.
###### 9
>  “ He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
>  “ And the constellations of the southern sky;
###### 10
>  “ He does great and unsearchable things,
>  “ And wonderful things without number.
###### 11
>  “ If he passes by me, I cannot see him,
>  “ If he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
###### 12
>  “ If he snatches away, who can turn him back?
>  “ Who dares to say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
###### ¶ 13
>  “ God does not restrain his anger;
>  “ Under him the helpers of Rahab lie crushed.”
## The Impossibility of Facing God in Court
###### 14
>  “ How much less, then, can I answer him
>  “ And choose my words to argue with him.
###### 15
>  “ Although I am innocent,
>  “ I could not answer him;
>  “ I could only plead with my judge for mercy.
###### 16
>  “ If I summoned him, and he answered me,
>  “ I would not believe
>  “ That he would be listening to my voice—
###### 17
>  “ He who crushes me with a tempest,
>  “ And multiplies my wounds for no reason.
###### 18
>  “ He does not allow me to recover my breath,
>  “ For he fills me with bitterness.
###### 19
>  “ If it is a matter of strength,
>  “ Most certainly he is the strong one!
>  “ And if it is a matter of justice,
>  “ He will say, ‘Who will summon me?’
###### 20
>  “ Although I am innocent,
>  “ My mouth would condemn me,
>  “ Although I am blameless,
>  “ It would declare me perverse.
###### 21
>  “ I am blameless. I do not know myself.
>  “ I despise my life.”
## Accusation of God’s Justice
###### 22
>  “ It is all one! That is why I say,
>  ‘ He destroys the blameless and the guilty.’
###### 23
>  “ If a scourge brings sudden death,
>  “ He mocks at the despair of the innocent.
###### 24
>  “ If a land has been given
>  “ Into the hand of a wicked man,
>  “ He covers the faces of its judges;
>  “ If it is not he, then who is it?”
## Renewed Complaint
###### ¶ 25
>  “ My days are swifter than a runner,
>  “ They speed by without seeing happiness.
###### 26
>  “ They glide by like reed boats,
>  “ Like an eagle that swoops down on its prey.
###### 27
>  “ If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
>  ‘ I will change my expression and be cheerful,’
###### 28
>  “ I dread all my sufferings,
>  “ For I know that you do not hold me blameless.
###### 29
>  “ If I am guilty,
>  “ Why then weary myself in vain?
###### 30
>  “ If I wash myself with snow-melt water,
>  “ And make my hands clean with lye,
###### 31
>  “ Then you plunge me into a slimy pit
>  “ And my own clothes abhor me.
###### 32
>  “ For he is not a human being like I am,
>  “ That I might answer him,
>  “ That we might come together in judgment.
###### 33
>  “ Nor is there an arbiter between us,
>  “ Who might lay his hand on us both,
###### 34
>  “ Who would take his rod away from me
>  “ So that his terror would not make me afraid.
###### 35
>  “ Then would I speak and not fear him,
>  “ But it is not so with me.
