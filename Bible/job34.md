# Job 34
## Elihu’s Second Speech
###### ¶ 1
Elihu answered:
###### 2
> “Listen to my words, you wise men;
> “Hear me, you learned men.
###### 3
> “For the ear assesses words
> “As the mouth tastes food.
###### 4
> “Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right;
> “Let us come to know among ourselves what is good.
###### 5
> “For Job says, ‘I am innocent,
> ‘But God turns away my right.
###### 6
> ‘Concerning my right, should I lie?
> ‘My wound is incurable,
> ‘Although I am without transgression.’
###### 7
> “Who is there like Job,
> “Who drinks derision like water?
###### 8
> “He goes about in company with evildoers,
> “He goes along with wicked men.
###### 9
> “For he says, ‘It does not profit a man
> ‘When he makes his delight with God.’
## God is Not Unjust
###### ¶ 10
> “Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding.
> “Far be it from God to do wickedness,
> “From the Almighty to do evil.
###### 11
> “For he repays a person for his work,
> “And according to the conduct of a person,
> “He causes the consequences to find him.
###### 12
> “Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly,
> “And the Almighty does not pervert justice.
###### 13
> “Who entrusted to him the earth?
> “And who put him over the whole world?
###### 14
> “If God were to set his heart on it,
> “And gather in his spirit and his breath,
###### 15
> “All flesh would perish together
> “And human beings would return to dust.”
## God Is Impartial and Omniscient
###### ¶ 16
> “If you have understanding, listen to this,
> “Hear what I have to say.
###### 17
> “Do you really think
> “That one who hates justice can govern?
> “And will you declare guilty
> “The supremely Righteous One,
###### 18
> “Who says to a king, ‘Worthless man,’
> “And to nobles, ‘Wicked men,’
###### 19
> “Who shows no partiality to princes,
> “And does not take note of the rich more than the poor,
> “Because all of them are the work of his hands?
###### 20
> “In a moment they die, in the middle of the night,
> “People are shaken and they pass away.
> “The mighty are removed effortlessly.
###### ¶ 21
> “For his eyes are on the ways of an individual,
> “He observes all a person’s steps.
###### 22
> “There is no darkness, and no deep darkness,
> “Where evildoers can hide themselves.
###### 23
> “For he does not still consider a person,
> “That he should come before God in judgment.
###### 24
> “He shatters the great without inquiry,
> “And sets up others in their place.
###### 25
> “Therefore, he knows their deeds,
> “He overthrows them in the night
> “And they are crushed.
###### 26
> “He strikes them for their wickedness,
> “In a place where people can see,
###### 27
> “Because they have turned away from following him,
> “And have not understood any of his ways,
###### 28
> “So that they caused the cry of the poor
> “To come before him,
> “So that he hears the cry of the needy.
###### 29
> “But if God is quiet, who can condemn him?
> “If he hides his face, then who can see him?
> “Yet he is over the individual and the nation alike,
###### 30
> “So that the godless man should not rule,
> “And not lay snares for the people.”
## Job Is Foolish to Rebel
###### ¶ 31
> “Has anyone said to God,
> ‘I have endured chastisement,
> ‘But I will not act wrongly any more;
###### 32
> ‘Teach me what I cannot see;
> ‘If I have done evil, I will do so no more’?
###### 33
> “Is it your opinion that God should recompense it,
> “Because you reject this?
> “But you must choose, and not I,
> “So tell us what you know.
###### 34
> “Men of understanding say to me—
> “Any wise man listening to me says—
###### 35
> “That Job speaks without knowledge
> “And his words are without understanding.
###### 36
> “But Job will be tested to the end,
> “Because his answers are like those of wicked men.
###### 37
> “For he adds transgression to his sin;
> “In our midst he claps his hands,
> “And multiplies his words against God.”
