# Proverbs 27
###### ¶ 1
> Do not boast about tomorrow;
> For you do not know what a day may bring forth.
###### 2
> Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
> Someone else, and not your own lips.
###### 3
> A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,
> But vexation by a fool is more burdensome than the two of them.
###### 4
> Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,
> But who can stand before jealousy?
###### 5
> Better is open rebuke
> Than hidden love.
###### 6
> Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
> But the kisses of an enemy are excessive.
###### 7
> The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey,
> But to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet.
###### 8
> Like a bird that wanders from its nest,
> So is a person who wanders from his home.
###### 9
> Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,
> Likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.
###### 10
> Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend,
> And do not enter your brother’s house in the day of your disaster;
> A neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.
###### 11
> Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,
> So that I may answer anyone who taunts me.
###### 12
> A shrewd person saw danger—he hid himself;
> The naive passed right on by—they had to pay for it.
###### 13
> Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,
> And hold him in pledge on behalf of a stranger.
###### 14
> If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
> It will be counted as a curse to him.
###### 15
> A continual dripping on a rainy day—
> A contentious wife makes herself like that.
###### 16
> Whoever contains her has contained the wind
> Or can grasp oil with his right hand.
###### 17
> As iron sharpens iron,
> So a person sharpens his friend.
###### 18
> The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
> And whoever takes care of his master will be honored.
###### 19
> As in water the face is reflected as a face,
> So a person’s heart reflects the person.
###### 20
> As Death and Destruction are never satisfied,
> So the eyes of a person are never satisfied.
###### 21
> As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,
> So a person must put his praise to the test.
###### 22
> If you should pound the fool in the mortar
> Among the grain with the pestle,
> His foolishness would not depart from him.
###### ¶ 23
> Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks,
> Set your mind on your herds,
###### 24
> For riches do not last forever,
> Nor does a crown last from generation to generation.
###### 25
> When the hay is removed and new grass appears,
> And the grass from the hills is gathered in,
###### 26
> The lambs will be for your clothing,
> And the goats will be for the price of a field.
###### 27
> And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,
> For the food of your household,
> And for the sustenance of your servant girls.
