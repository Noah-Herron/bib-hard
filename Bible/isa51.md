# Isaiah 51
## There is Hope for the Future
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Listen to me, you who pursue godliness,
>  “ Who seek the LORD.
>  “ Look at the rock from which you were chiseled,
>  “ At the quarry from which you were dug.
###### 2
>  “ Look at Abraham, your father,
>  “ And Sarah, who gave you birth.
>  “ When I summoned him, he was a lone individual,
>  “ But I blessed him and gave him numerous descendants.
###### 3
>  “ Certainly the LORD will console Zion;
>  “ He will console all her ruins.
>  “ He will make her wilderness like Eden,
>  “ Her arid rift valley like the garden of the LORD.
>  “ Happiness and joy will be restored to her,
>  “ Thanksgiving and the sound of music.
###### ¶ 4
>  “ Pay attention to me, my people.
>  “ Listen to me, my people!
>  “ For I will issue a decree,
>  “ I will make my justice a light to the nations.
###### 5
>  “ I am ready to vindicate,
>  “ I am ready to deliver,
>  “ I will establish justice among the nations.
>  “ The coastlands wait patiently for me;
>  “ They wait in anticipation for the revelation of my power.
###### 6
>  “ Look up at the sky.
>  “ Look at the earth below.
>  “ For the sky will dissipate like smoke,
>  “ And the earth will wear out like clothes;
>  “ Its residents will die like gnats.
>  “ But the deliverance I give is permanent;
>  “ The vindication I provide will not disappear.
###### 7
>  “ Listen to me, you who know what is right,
>  “ You people who are aware of my law.
>  “ Don’t be afraid of the insults of men;
>  “ Don’t be discouraged because of their abuse.
###### 8
>  “ For a moth will eat away at them like clothes;
>  “ A clothes moth will devour them like wool.
>  “ But the vindication I provide will be permanent;
>  “ The deliverance I give will last.”
###### ¶ 9
> Wake up! Wake up!
> Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the LORD!
> Wake up as in former times, as in antiquity.
> Did you not smash the Proud One?
> Did you not wound the sea monster?
###### 10
> Did you not dry up the sea,
> The waters of the great deep?
> Did you not make a path through the depths of the sea,
> So those delivered from bondage could cross over?
###### 11
> Those whom the LORD has ransomed will return;
> They will enter Zion with a happy shout.
> Unending joy will crown them,
> Happiness and joy will overwhelm them;
> Grief and suffering will disappear.
###### ¶ 12
>  “ I, I am the one who consoles you.
>  “ Why are you afraid of mortal men,
>  “ Of mere human beings who are as short-lived as grass?
###### 13
>  “ Why do you forget the LORD, who made you,
>  “ Who stretched out the sky
>  “ And founded the earth?
>  “ Why do you constantly tremble all day long
>  “ At the anger of the oppressor,
>  “ When he makes plans to destroy?
>  “ Where is the anger of the oppressor?
###### 14
>  “ The one who suffers will soon be released;
>  “ He will not die in prison,
>  “ He will not go hungry.
###### 15
>  “ I am the LORD your God,
>  “ Who churns up the sea so that its waves surge.
>  “ The LORD of Heaven’s Armies is his name!”
## Zion’s Time to Celebrate
###### 16
>  “ I commission you as my spokesman;
>  “ I cover you with the palm of my hand,
>  “ To establish the sky and to found the earth,
>  “ To say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’”
###### ¶ 17
> Wake up! Wake up!
> Get up, O Jerusalem!
> You drank from the cup the LORD passed to you,
> Which was full of his anger.
> You drained dry
> The goblet full of intoxicating wine.
###### 18
> There was no one to lead her
> Among all the children she bore;
> There was no one to take her by the hand
> Among all the children she raised.
###### 19
> These double disasters confronted you.
> But who feels sorry for you?
> Destruction and devastation,
> Famine and sword.
> But who consoles you?
###### 20
> Your children faint;
> They lie at the head of every street
> Like an antelope in a snare.
> They are left in a stupor by the LORD’s anger,
> By the battle cry of your God.
###### ¶ 21
> So listen to this, oppressed one,
> Who is drunk, but not from wine.
###### 22
> This is what your Sovereign LORD, even your God who judges his people says:
>  “ Look, I have removed from your hand
>  “ The cup of intoxicating wine,
>  “ The goblet full of my anger.
>  “ You will no longer have to drink it.
###### 23
>  “ I will put it into the hand of your tormentors
>  “ Who said to you, ‘Lie down, so we can walk over you.’
>  “ You made your back like the ground,
>  “ And like the street for those who walked over you.”
