# Hosea 11
## Reversal of the Exodus: Return to Egypt and Exile in Assyria
###### ¶ 1
> “When Israel was a young man, I loved him like a son,
> “And I summoned my son out of Egypt.
###### 2
> “But the more I summoned them,
> “The farther they departed from me.
> “They sacrificed to the Baal idols
> “And burned incense to images.
###### 3
> “Yet it was I who led Ephraim;
> “I took them by the arm,
> “But they did not acknowledge
> “That I had healed them.
###### 4
> “I drew them with leather cords,
> “With straps of hide;
> “I lifted the yoke from their neck,
> “And gently fed them.
###### ¶ 5
> “They will return to Egypt!
> “Assyria will rule over them
> “Because they refuse to repent!
###### 6
> “A sword will flash in their cities,
> “It will destroy the bars of their city gates,
> “And will devour them in their fortresses.
###### 7
> “My people are obsessed with turning away from me;
> “They call to Baal, but he will never exalt them!”
## The Divine Dilemma: Judgment or Mercy?
###### ¶ 8
> “How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
> “How can I surrender you, O Israel?
> “How can I treat you like Admah?
> “How can I make you like Zeboyim?
> “I have had a change of heart.
> “All my tender compassions are aroused.
###### 9
> “I cannot carry out my fierce anger!
> “I cannot totally destroy Ephraim!
> “Because I am God, and not man—the Holy One among you—
> “I will not come in wrath!”
## God Will Restore the Exiles to Israel
###### 10
> “He will roar like a lion,
> “And they will follow the LORD;
> “When he roars,
> “His children will come trembling from the west.
###### 11
> “They will return in fear and trembling
> “Like birds from Egypt,
> “Like doves from Assyria,
> “And I will settle them in their homes,” declares the LORD.
## God’s Lawsuit against Israel: Breach of Covenant
###### ¶ 12
>  Ephraim has surrounded me with lies;
> The house of Israel has surrounded me with deceit.
> But Judah still roams about with God;
> He remains faithful to the Holy One.
