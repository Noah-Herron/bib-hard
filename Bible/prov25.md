# Proverbs 25
## Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah
###### ¶ 1
These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied:
###### ¶ 2
> It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
> And it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.
###### 3
> As the heaven is high and the earth is deep
> So the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
###### 4
> Remove the dross from the silver,
> And material for the silversmith will emerge;
###### 5
> Remove the wicked from before the king,
> And his throne will be established in righteousness.
###### 6
> Do not honor yourself before the king,
> And do not stand in the place of great men;
###### 7
> For it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”
> Than to put you lower before a prince,
> Whom your eyes have seen.
###### ¶ 8
> Do not go out hastily to litigation,
> Or what will you do afterward
> When your neighbor puts you to shame?
###### 9
> When you argue a case with your neighbor,
> Do not reveal the secret of another person,
###### 10
> Lest the one who hears it put you to shame
> And your infamy will never go away.
###### ¶ 11
> Like apples of gold in settings of silver,
> So is a word skillfully spoken.
###### 12
> Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,
> So is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens.
###### 13
> Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
> So is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
> For he refreshes the heart of his masters.
###### 14
> Like cloudy skies and wind that produce no rain,
> So is the one who boasts of a gift not given.
###### 15
> Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
> And a soft tongue can break a bone.
###### 16
> You have found honey—eat only what is sufficient for you,
> Lest you become stuffed with it and vomit it up.
###### 17
> Don’t set foot too frequently in your neighbor’s house,
>  “ Lest he become weary of you and hate you.
###### 18
>  “ Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow,
>  “ So is the one who testifies against his neighbor as a false witness.
###### 19
>  “ Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint,
>  “ So is confidence in an unfaithful person at the time of trouble.
###### 20
>  “ Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
>  “ Or like vinegar poured on soda,
>  “ So is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
###### 21
>  “ If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
>  “ And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
###### 22
>  “ For you will heap coals of fire on his head,
>  “ And the LORD will reward you.
###### 23
>  “ The north wind brings forth rain,
>  “ And a gossiping tongue brings forth an angry look.
###### 24
>  “ It is better to live on a corner of the housetop
>  “ Than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.
###### 25
>  “ Like cold water to a weary person,
>  “ So is good news from a distant land.
###### 26
>  “ Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,
>  “ So is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked.
###### 27
>  “ It is not good to eat too much honey,
>  “ Nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory.
###### 28
>  “ Like a city that is broken down and without a wall,
>  “ So is a person who cannot control his temper.
