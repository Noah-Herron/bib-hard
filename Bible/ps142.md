# Psalm 142
###### ¶ 1
> To the LORD I cry out;
> To the LORD I plead for mercy.
###### 2
> I pour out my lament before him;
> I tell him about my troubles.
###### 3
> Even when my strength leaves me,
> You watch my footsteps.
> In the path where I walk
> They have hidden a trap for me.
###### 4
> Look to the right and see.
> No one cares about me.
> I have nowhere to run;
> No one is concerned about my life.
###### ¶ 5
> I cry out to you, O LORD;
> I say, “You are my shelter,
>  “ My security in the land of the living.”
###### 6
> Listen to my cry for help,
> For I am in serious trouble.
> Rescue me from those who chase me,
> For they are stronger than I am.
###### 7
> Free me from prison,
> That I may give thanks to your name.
> Because of me the godly will assemble,
> For you will vindicate me.
