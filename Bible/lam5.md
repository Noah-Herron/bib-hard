# Lamentations 5
## The People of Jerusalem Pray
###### ¶ 1
> O LORD, reflect on what has happened to us;
> Consider and look at our disgrace.
###### 2
> Our inheritance is turned over to strangers;
> Foreigners now occupy our homes.
###### 3
> We have become fatherless orphans;
> Our mothers have become widows.
###### 4
> We must pay money for our own water;
> We must buy our own wood at a steep price.
###### 5
> We are pursued—they are breathing down our necks;
> We are weary and have no rest.
###### 6
> We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria
> In order to buy food to eat.
###### 7
> Our forefathers sinned and are dead,
> But we suffer their punishment.
###### 8
> Slaves rule over us;
> There is no one to rescue us from their power.
###### 9
> At the risk of our lives we get our food
> Because robbers lurk in the wilderness.
###### 10
> Our skin is as hot as an oven
> Due to a fever from hunger.
###### 11
> They raped women in Zion,
> Virgins in the towns of Judah.
###### 12
> Princes were hung by their hands;
> Elders were mistreated.
###### 13
> The young men perform menial labor;
> Boys stagger from their labor.
###### 14
> The elders are gone from the city gate;
> The young men have stopped playing their music.
###### 15
> Our hearts no longer have any joy;
> Our dancing is turned to mourning.
###### 16
> The crown has fallen from our head;
> Woe to us, for we have sinned!
###### 17
> Because of this, our hearts are sick;
> Because of these things, we can hardly see through our tears.
###### 18
> For wild animals are prowling over Mount Zion,
> Which lies desolate.
###### ¶ 19
> But you, O LORD, reign forever;
> Your throne endures from generation to generation.
###### 20
> Why do you keep on forgetting us?
> Why do you forsake us so long?
###### 21
> Bring us back to yourself, O LORD, so that we may return to you;
> Renew our life as in days before,
###### 22
> Unless you have utterly rejected us
> And are angry with us beyond measure.
