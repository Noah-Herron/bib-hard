# Isaiah 61
## The Lord Will Rejuvenate His People
###### ¶ 1
> The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is upon me,
> Because the LORD has chosen me.
> He has commissioned me to encourage the poor,
> To help the brokenhearted,
> To decree the release of captives,
> And the freeing of prisoners,
###### 2
> To announce the year when the LORD will show his favor,
> The day when our God will seek vengeance,
> To console all who mourn,
###### 3
> To strengthen those who mourn in Zion,
> By giving them a turban, instead of ashes,
> Oil symbolizing joy, instead of mourning,
> A garment symbolizing praise, instead of discouragement.
> They will be called oaks of righteousness,
> Trees planted by the LORD to reveal his splendor.
###### ¶ 4
> They will rebuild the perpetual ruins
> And restore the places that were desolate;
> They will reestablish the ruined cities,
> The places that have been desolate since ancient times.
###### 5
> “Foreigners will take care of your sheep;
> “Foreigners will work in your fields and vineyards.
###### 6
> “You will be called, ‘the LORD’s priests,
> ‘Servants of our God.’
> “You will enjoy the wealth of nations
> “And boast about the riches you receive from them.
###### 7
> “Instead of shame, you will get a double portion;
> “Instead of humiliation, they will rejoice over the land they receive.
> “Yes, they will possess a double portion in their land
> “And experience lasting joy.
###### 8
> “For I, the LORD, love justice
> “And hate robbery and sin.
> “I will repay them because of my faithfulness;
> “I will make a permanent covenant with them.
###### 9
> “Their descendants will be known among the nations,
> “Their offspring among the peoples.
> “All who see them will recognize that
> “The LORD has blessed them.”
###### ¶ 10
> I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;
> I will be overjoyed because of my God.
> For he clothes me in garments of deliverance;
> He puts on me a robe symbolizing vindication.
> I look like a bridegroom when he wears a turban as a priest would;
> I look like a bride when she puts on her jewelry.
###### 11
> For just as the ground produces its crops
> And a garden yields its produce,
> So the Sovereign LORD will cause deliverance to grow,
> And give his people reason to praise him in the sight of all the nations.
