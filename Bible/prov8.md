# Proverbs 8
## The Appeal of Wisdom
###### ¶ 1
> Does not wisdom call out?
> Does not understanding raise her voice?
###### 2
> At the top of the prominent places along the way,
> At the intersection of the paths she has taken her stand;
###### 3
> Beside the gates opening into the city,
> At the entrance of the doorways she cries out:
###### 4
>  “ To you, O people, I call out,
>  “ And my voice calls to all mankind.
###### 5
>  “ You who are naive, discern wisdom!
>  “ And you fools, understand discernment!
###### 6
>  “ Listen, for I will speak excellent things,
>  “ And my lips will utter what is right.
###### 7
>  “ For my mouth speaks truth,
>  “ And my lips hate wickedness.
###### 8
>  “ All the words of my mouth are righteous;
>  “ There is nothing in them twisted or crooked.
###### 9
>  “ All of them are clear to the discerning
>  “ And upright to those who find knowledge.
###### 10
>  “ Receive my instruction rather than silver,
>  “ And knowledge rather than choice gold.
###### 11
>  “ For wisdom is better than rubies,
>  “ And desirable things cannot be compared to her.
###### ¶ 12
>  “ I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence,
>  “ And I find knowledge and discretion.
###### 13
>  “ The fear of the LORD is to hate evil;
>  “ I hate arrogant pride and the evil way
>  “ And perverse utterances.
###### 14
>  “ Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me;
>  “ I possess understanding and might.
###### 15
>  “ By me kings reign,
>  “ And by me potentates decree righteousness;
###### 16
>  “ By me princes rule,
>  “ As well as nobles and all righteous judges.
###### 17
>  “ I will love those who love me,
>  “ And those who seek me diligently will find me.
###### 18
>  “ Riches and honor are with me,
>  “ Long-lasting wealth and righteousness.
###### 19
>  “ My fruit is better than the purest gold,
>  “ And my harvest is better than choice silver.
###### 20
>  “ I walk in the path of righteousness,
>  “ In the pathway of justice,
###### 21
>  “ That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth,
>  “ And that I may fill their treasuries.
###### ¶ 22
>  “ The LORD created me as the beginning of his works,
>  “ Before his deeds of long ago.
###### 23
>  “ From eternity I have been fashioned,
>  “ From the beginning, from before the world existed.
###### 24
>  “ When there were no deep oceans I was born,
>  “ When there were no springs overflowing with water;
###### 25
>  “ Before the mountains were set in place—
>  “ Before the hills—I was born,
###### 26
>  “ Before he made the earth and its fields,
>  “ Or the top soil of the world.
###### 27
>  “ When he established the heavens, I was there;
>  “ When he marked out the horizon over the face of the deep,
###### 28
>  “ When he established the clouds above,
>  “ When he secured the fountains of the deep,
###### 29
>  “ When he gave the sea his decree
>  “ That the waters should not pass over his command,
>  “ When he marked out the foundations of the earth,
###### 30
>  “ Then I was beside him as a master craftsman,
>  “ And I was his delight day by day,
>  “ Rejoicing before him at all times,
###### 31
>  “ Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth,
>  “ And delighting in its people.
###### ¶ 32
>  “ So now, children, listen to me;
>  “ Blessed are those who keep my ways.
###### 33
>  “ Listen to my instruction so that you may be wise,
>  “ And do not neglect it.
###### 34
>  “ Blessed is the one who listens to me,
>  “ Watching at my doors day by day,
>  “ Waiting beside my doorway.
###### 35
>  “ For the one who finds me has found life
>  “ And received favor from the LORD.
###### 36
>  “ But the one who misses me brings harm to himself;
>  “ All who hate me love death.”
