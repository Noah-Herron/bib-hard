# Isaiah 44
## The Lord Will Renew Israel
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Now, listen, Jacob my servant,
>  “ Israel whom I have chosen!”
###### 2
> This is what the LORD, the one who made you, says—
> The one who formed you in the womb and helps you:
>  “ Don’t be afraid, my servant Jacob,
>  “ Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
###### 3
>  “ For I will pour water on the parched ground
>  “ And cause streams to flow on the dry land.
>  “ I will pour my Spirit on your offspring
>  “ And my blessing on your children.
###### 4
>  “ They will sprout up like a tree in the grass,
>  “ Like poplars beside channels of water.
###### 5
>  “ One will say, ‘I belong to the LORD,’
>  “ And another will use the name ‘Jacob.’
>  “ One will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’
>  “ And use the name ‘Israel.’”
## The Absurdity of Idolatry
###### ¶ 6
> This is what the LORD, Israel’s king, says,
> Their Protector, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies:
>  “ I am the first and I am the last,
>  “ There is no God but me.
###### 7
>  “ Who is like me? Let him make his claim!
>  “ Let him announce it and explain it to me—
>  “ Since I established an ancient people—
>  “ Let them announce future events.
###### 8
>  “ Don’t panic! Don’t be afraid!
>  “ Did I not tell you beforehand and decree it?
>  “ You are my witnesses! Is there any God but me?
>  “ There is no other sheltering rock; I know of none.
###### ¶ 9
>  “ All who form idols are nothing;
>  “ The things in which they delight are worthless.
>  “ Their witnesses cannot see;
>  “ They recognize nothing, so they are put to shame.
###### 10
>  “ Who forms a god and casts an idol
>  “ That will prove worthless?
###### 11
>  “ Look, all his associates will be put to shame;
>  “ The craftsmen are mere humans.
>  “ Let them all assemble and take their stand.
>  “ They will panic and be put to shame.
###### ¶ 12
>  “ A blacksmith works with his tool
>  “ And forges metal over the coals.
>  “ He forms it with hammers;
>  “ He makes it with his strong arm.
>  “ He gets hungry and loses his energy;
>  “ He drinks no water and gets tired.
###### 13
>  “ A carpenter takes measurements;
>  “ He marks out an outline of its form;
>  “ He scrapes it with chisels,
>  “ And marks it with a compass.
>  “ He patterns it after the human form,
>  “ Like a well-built human being,
>  “ And puts it in a shrine.
###### 14
>  “ He cuts down cedars
>  “ And acquires a cypress or an oak.
>  “ He gets trees from the forest;
>  “ He plants a cedar and the rain makes it grow.
###### 15
>  “ A man uses it to make a fire;
>  “ He takes some of it and warms himself.
>  “ Yes, he kindles a fire and bakes bread.
>  “ Then he makes a god and worships it;
>  “ He makes an idol and bows down to it.
###### 16
>  “ Half of it he burns in the fire—
>  “ Over that half he cooks meat;
>  “ He roasts a meal and fills himself.
>  “ Yes, he warms himself and says,
>  ‘ Ah! I am warm as I look at the fire.’
###### 17
>  “ With the rest of it he makes a god, his idol;
>  “ He bows down to it and worships it.
>  “ He prays to it, saying,
>  ‘ Rescue me, for you are my god!’
###### ¶ 18
>  “ They do not comprehend or understand,
>  “ For their eyes are blind and cannot see;
>  “ Their minds do not discern.
###### 19
>  “ No one thinks to himself,
>  “ Nor do they comprehend or understand and say to themselves:
>  ‘ I burned half of it in the fire—
>  ‘ Yes, I baked bread over the coals;
>  ‘ I roasted meat and ate it.
>  ‘ With the rest of it should I make a disgusting idol?
>  ‘ Should I bow down to dry wood?’
###### 20
>  “ He feeds on ashes;
>  “ His deceived mind misleads him.
>  “ He cannot rescue himself,
>  “ Nor does he say, ‘Is this not a false god I hold in my right hand?’
###### ¶ 21
>  “ Remember these things, O Jacob,
>  “ O Israel, for you are my servant.
>  “ I formed you to be my servant;
>  “ O Israel, I will not forget you!
###### 22
>  “ I remove the guilt of your rebellious deeds as if they were a cloud,
>  “ The guilt of your sins as if they were a cloud.
>  “ Come back to me, for I protect you.”
###### 23
> Shout for joy, O sky, for the LORD intervenes;
> Shout out, you subterranean regions of the earth.
> O mountains, give a joyful shout;
> You too, O forest and all your trees!
> For the LORD protects Jacob;
> He reveals his splendor through Israel.
## The Lord Empowers Cyrus
###### ¶ 24
> This is what the LORD, your Protector, says,
> The one who formed you in the womb:
>  “ I am the LORD, who made everything,
>  “ Who alone stretched out the sky,
>  “ Who fashioned the earth all by myself,
###### 25
>  “ Who frustrates the omens of the empty talkers
>  “ And humiliates the omen readers,
>  “ Who overturns the counsel of the wise men
>  “ And makes their advice seem foolish,
###### 26
>  “ Who fulfills the oracles of his prophetic servants
>  “ And brings to pass the announcements of his messengers,
>  “ Who says about Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited,’
>  “ And about the towns of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt,
>  ‘ Her ruins I will raise up,’
###### 27
>  “ Who says to the deep sea, ‘Be dry!
>  ‘ I will dry up your sea currents,’
###### 28
>  “ Who commissions Cyrus, the one I appointed as shepherd
>  “ To carry out all my wishes
>  “ And to decree concerning Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’
>  “ And concerning the temple, ‘It will be reconstructed.’
