# Judges 5
## Celebrating the Victory in Song
###### ¶ 1
On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this victory song:
###### 2
>  “ When the leaders took the lead in Israel,
>  “ When the people answered the call to war—
>  “ Praise the LORD!
###### 3
>  “ Hear, O kings!
>  “ Pay attention, O rulers!
>  “ I will sing to the LORD!
>  “ I will sing to the LORD God of Israel!
###### 4
>  “ O LORD, when you departed from Seir,
>  “ When you marched from Edom’s plains,
>  “ The earth shook, the heavens poured down,
>  “ The clouds poured down rain.
###### 5
>  “ The mountains trembled before the LORD, the God of Sinai;
>  “ Before the LORD God of Israel.
###### ¶ 6
>  “ In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
>  “ In the days of Jael caravans disappeared;
>  “ Travelers had to go on winding side roads.
###### 7
>  “ Warriors were scarce;
>  “ They were scarce in Israel,
>  “ Until you arose, Deborah,
>  “ Until you arose as a motherly protector in Israel.
###### 8
>  “ God chose new leaders,
>  “ Then fighters appeared in the city gates;
>  “ But, I swear, not a shield or spear could be found
>  “ Among forty military units in Israel.
###### 9
>  “ My heart went out to Israel’s leaders,
>  “ To the people who answered the call to war.
>  “ Praise the LORD!
###### 10
>  “ You who ride on light-colored female donkeys,
>  “ Who sit on saddle blankets,
>  “ You who walk on the road, pay attention!
###### 11
>  “ Hear the sound of those who divide the sheep among the watering places;
>  “ There they tell of the LORD’s victorious deeds,
>  “ The victorious deeds of his warriors in Israel.
>  “ Then the LORD’s people went down to the city gates—
###### ¶ 12
>  “ Wake up, wake up, Deborah!
>  “ Wake up, wake up, sing a song!
>  “ Get up, Barak!
>  “ Capture your prisoners of war, son of Abinoam!
###### 13
>  “ Then the survivors came down to the mighty ones;
>  “ The LORD’s people came down to me as warriors.
###### 14
>  “ They came from Ephraim, who uprooted Amalek;
>  “ They follow after you, Benjamin, with your soldiers.
>  “ From Makir leaders came down,
>  “ From Zebulun came the ones who march carrying an officer’s staff.
###### 15
>  “ Issachar’s leaders were with Deborah;
>  “ The men of Issachar supported Barak;
>  “ Into the valley they were sent under Barak’s command.
>  “ Among the clans of Reuben there was intense heart searching.
###### 16
>  “ Why do you remain among the sheepfolds,
>  “ Listening to the shepherds playing their pipes for their flocks?
>  “ As for the clans of Reuben—there was intense searching of heart.
###### 17
>  “ Gilead stayed put beyond the Jordan River.
>  “ As for Dan—why did he seek temporary employment in the shipyards?
>  “ Asher remained on the seacoast;
>  “ He stayed by his harbors.
###### 18
>  “ The men of Zebulun were not concerned about their lives;
>  “ Naphtali charged onto the battlefields.
###### ¶ 19
>  “ Kings came, they fought;
>  “ The kings of Canaan fought
>  “ At Taanach by the waters of Megiddo,
>  “ But they took no silver as plunder.
###### 20
>  “ From the sky the stars fought,
>  “ From their paths in the heavens they fought against Sisera.
###### 21
>  “ The Kishon River carried them off;
>  “ The river confronted them—the Kishon River.
>  “ Step on the necks of the strong!
###### 22
>  “ The horses’ hooves pounded the ground;
>  “ The stallions galloped madly.
###### 23
>  ‘ Call judgment down on Meroz,’ says the angel of the LORD;
>  ‘ Be sure to call judgment down on those who live there,
>  ‘ Because they did not come to help in the LORD’s battle,
>  ‘ To help in the LORD’s battle against the warriors.’
###### ¶ 24
>  “ The most rewarded of women should be Jael,
>  “ The wife of Heber the Kenite!
>  “ She should be the most rewarded of women who live in tents.
###### 25
>  “ He asked for water,
>  “ And she gave him milk;
>  “ In a bowl fit for a king,
>  “ She served him curds.
###### 26
>  “ Her left hand reached for the tent peg,
>  “ Her right hand for the workmen’s hammer.
>  “ She “hammered” Sisera,
> She shattered his skull,
> She smashed his head,
> She drove the tent peg through his temple.
###### 27
> Between her feet he collapsed,
> He fell limp and was lifeless;
> Between her feet he collapsed and fell,
> In the spot where he collapsed,
> There he fell—violently killed!
###### ¶ 28
> Through the window she looked;
> Sisera’s mother cried out through the lattice:
>  ‘ Why is his chariot so slow to return?
>  ‘ Why are the hoofbeats of his chariot horses delayed?’
###### 29
>  “ The wisest of her ladies answer;
>  “ Indeed she even thinks to herself,
###### 30
>  ‘ No doubt they are gathering and dividing the plunder—
>  ‘ A girl or two for each man to rape!
>  ‘ Sisera is grabbing up colorful cloth,
>  ‘ He is grabbing up colorful embroidered cloth,
>  ‘ Two pieces of colorful embroidered cloth,
>  ‘ For the neck of the plunderer!’
###### 31
>  “ May all your enemies perish like this, O LORD!
>  “ But may those who love you shine
>  “ Like the rising sun at its brightest.”
And the land had rest for forty years.
