# Isaiah 40
## The Lord Returns to Jerusalem
###### ¶ 1
> “Comfort, comfort my people,”
> Says your God.
###### 2
> “Speak kindly to Jerusalem and tell her
> “That her time of warfare is over,
> “That her punishment is completed.
> “For the LORD has made her pay double for all her sins.”
###### ¶ 3
> A voice cries out,
> “In the wilderness clear a way for the LORD;
> “Build a level road through the rift valley for our God.
###### 4
> “Every valley must be elevated,
> “And every mountain and hill leveled.
> “The rough terrain will become a level plain,
> “The rugged landscape a wide valley.
###### 5
> “The splendor of the LORD will be revealed,
> “And all people will see it at the same time.
> “For the LORD has decreed it.”
###### 6
> A voice says, “Cry out!”
> Another asks, “What should I cry out?”
> The first voice responds: “All people are like grass,
> “And all their promises are like the flowers in the field.
###### 7
> “The grass dries up,
> “The flowers wither,
> “When the wind sent by the LORD blows on them.
> “Surely humanity is like grass.
###### 8
> “The grass dries up,
> “The flowers wither,
> “But the decree of our God is forever reliable.”
###### ¶ 9
> Go up on a high mountain, O herald Zion.
> Shout out loudly, O herald Jerusalem!
> Shout, don’t be afraid!
> “Say to the towns of Judah,
> “Here is your God!”
###### 10
> Look, the Sovereign LORD comes as a victorious warrior;
> His military power establishes his rule.
> Look, his reward is with him;
> His prize goes before him.
###### 11
> Like a shepherd he tends his flock;
> He gathers up the lambs with his arm;
> He carries them close to his heart;
> He leads the ewes along.
## The Lord is Incomparable
###### ¶ 12
> Who has measured out the waters in the hollow of his hand,
> Or carefully measured the sky,
> Or carefully weighed the soil of the earth,
> Or weighed the mountains in a balance,
> Or the hills on scales?
###### 13
> Who comprehends the mind of the LORD,
> Or gives him instruction as his counselor?
###### 14
> From whom does he receive directions?
> Who teaches him the correct way to do things,
> Or imparts knowledge to him,
> Or instructs him in skillful design?
###### 15
> Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
> They are regarded as dust on the scales.
> He lifts the coastlands as if they were dust.
###### 16
> Not even Lebanon could supply enough firewood for a sacrifice;
> Its wild animals would not provide enough burnt offerings.
###### 17
> All the nations are insignificant before him;
> They are regarded as absolutely nothing.
###### ¶ 18
> To whom can you compare God?
> To what image can you liken him?
###### 19
> A craftsman casts an idol;
> A metalsmith overlays it with gold
> And forges silver chains for it.
###### 20
> To make a contribution one selects wood that will not rot;
> He then seeks a skilled craftsman
> To make an idol that will not fall over.
###### ¶ 21
> Do you not know?
> Do you not hear?
> Has it not been told to you since the very beginning?
> Have you not understood from the time the earth’s foundations were made?
###### 22
> He is the one who sits on the earth’s horizon;
> Its inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him.
> He is the one who stretches out the sky like a thin curtain,
> And spreads it out like a pitched tent.
###### 23
> He is the one who reduces rulers to nothing;
> He makes the earth’s leaders insignificant.
###### 24
> Indeed, they are barely planted;
> Yes, they are barely sown;
> Yes, they barely take root in the earth,
> And then he blows on them, causing them to dry up,
> And the wind carries them away like straw.
###### 25
> “To whom can you compare me? Whom do I resemble?”
> Says the Holy One.
###### 26
> Look up at the sky!
> Who created all these heavenly lights?
> He is the one who leads out their ranks;
> He calls them all by name.
> Because of his absolute power and awesome strength,
> Not one of them is missing.
###### ¶ 27
> Why do you say, Jacob,
> Why do you say, Israel,
> “The LORD is not aware of what is happening to me;
> “My God is not concerned with my vindication”?
###### 28
> Do you not know?
> Have you not heard?
> The LORD is an eternal God,
> The Creator of the whole earth.
> He does not get tired or weary;
> There is no limit to his wisdom.
###### 29
> He gives strength to those who are tired;
> To the ones who lack power, he gives renewed energy.
###### 30
> Even youths get tired and weary;
> Even strong young men clumsily stumble.
###### 31
> But those who wait for the LORD’s help find renewed strength;
> They rise up as if they had eagles’ wings,
> They run without growing weary,
> They walk without getting tired.
