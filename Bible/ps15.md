> Who may live on your holy hill?
###### 2
> Whoever lives a blameless life,
> Does what is right,
> And speaks honestly.
###### 3
> He does not slander,
> Or do harm to others,
> Or insult his neighbor.
###### 4
> He despises a reprobate,
> But honors the LORD’s loyal followers.
> He makes firm commitments and does not renege on his promise.
###### 5

> He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.
> The one who lives like this will never be shaken.
