# Job 4
## Eliphaz Begins to Speak
###### ¶ 1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
###### 2
> “If someone should attempt a word with you,
> “Will you be impatient?
> “But who can refrain from speaking?
###### 3
> “Look, you have instructed many;
> “You have strengthened feeble hands.
###### 4
> “Your words have supported those
> “Who stumbled,
> “And you have strengthened the knees
> “That gave way.
###### 5
> “But now the same thing comes to you,
> “And you are discouraged;
> “It strikes you,
> “And you are terrified.
###### 6
> “Is not your piety your confidence,
> “And your blameless ways your hope?
###### ¶ 7
> “Call to mind now:
> “Who, being innocent, ever perished?
> “And where were upright people ever destroyed?
###### 8
> “Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity
> “And those who sow trouble reap the same.
###### 9
> “By the breath of God they perish,
> “And by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
###### 10
> “There is the roaring of the lion
> “And the growling of the young lion,
> “But the teeth of the young lions are broken.
###### 11
> “The mighty lion perishes for lack of prey,
> “And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.”
## Ungodly Complainers Provoke God’s Wrath
###### ¶ 12
> “Now a word was stealthily brought to me,
> “And my ear caught a whisper of it.
###### 13
> “In the troubling thoughts of the dreams in the night
> “When a deep sleep falls on men,
###### 14
> “Dread gripped me and trembling,
> “Which made all my bones shake.
###### 15
> “Then a breath of air passes by my face;
> “It makes the hair of my flesh stand up.
###### 16
> “It stands still,
> “But I cannot recognize its appearance;
> “An image is before my eyes,
> “And I hear a murmuring voice:
###### 17
> ‘Is a mortal man righteous before God?
> ‘Or a man pure before his Creator?
###### 18
> ‘If God puts no trust in his servants
> ‘And attributes folly to his angels,
###### 19
> ‘How much more to those who live in houses of clay,
> ‘Whose foundation is in the dust,
> ‘Who are crushed like a moth?
###### 20
> ‘They are destroyed between morning and evening;
> ‘They perish forever without anyone regarding it.
###### 21
> ‘Is not their excess wealth taken away from them?
> ‘They die, yet without attaining wisdom.’
