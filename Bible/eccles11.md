# Ecclesiastes 11
## Ignorance of the Future Demands Diligence in the Present
###### ¶ 1
> Send your grain overseas,
> For after many days you will get a return.
###### 2
> Divide your merchandise among seven or even eight investments,
> For you do not know what calamity may happen on earth.
###### 3
> If the clouds are full of rain, they will empty themselves on the earth,
> And whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, the tree will lie wherever it falls.
###### 4
> He who watches the wind will not sow,
> And he who observes the clouds will not reap.
###### 5
> Just as you do not know the path of the wind,
> Or how the bones form in the womb of a pregnant woman,
> So you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
###### ¶ 6
> Sow your seed in the morning,
> And do not stop working until the evening;
> For you do not know which activity will succeed—
> Whether this one or that one, or whether both will prosper equally.
## Life Should Be Enjoyed Because Death is Inevitable
###### ¶ 7
> Light is sweet,
> And it is pleasant for a person to see the sun.
###### 8
> So, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all,
> But let him remember that the days of darkness will be many—all that is about to come is obscure.
## Enjoy Life to the Fullest under the Fear of God
###### ¶ 9
> Rejoice, young man, while you are young,
> And let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.
> Follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes,
> But know that God will judge your motives and actions.
###### 10
> Banish emotional stress from your mind.
> And put away pain from your body;
> For youth and the prime of life are fleeting.
