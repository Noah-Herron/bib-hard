# Proverbs 2
## Benefits of Seeking Wisdom
###### ¶ 1
> My child, if you receive my words,
> And store up my commands inside yourself,
###### 2
> By making your ear attentive to wisdom,
> And by turning your heart to understanding,
###### 3
> Indeed, if you call out for discernment—
> Shout loudly for understanding—
###### 4
> If you seek it like silver,
> And search for it like hidden treasure,
###### 5
> Then you will understand how to fear the LORD,
> And you will discover knowledge about God.
###### 6
> For the LORD gives wisdom,
> And from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
###### 7
> He stores up effective counsel for the upright,
> And is like a shield for those who live with integrity,
###### 8
> To guard the paths of the righteous
> And to protect the way of his pious ones.
###### 9
> Then you will understand righteousness and justice
> And equity—every good way.
###### 10
> For wisdom will enter your heart,
> And moral knowledge will be attractive to you.
###### 11
> Discretion will protect you,
> Understanding will guard you,
###### 12
> To deliver you from the way of the wicked,
> From those speaking perversity,
###### 13
> Who leave the upright paths
> To walk on the dark ways,
###### 14
> Who delight in doing evil,
> They rejoice in perverse evil;
###### 15
> Whose paths are morally crooked,
> And who are devious in their ways;
###### 16
> To deliver you from the adulterous woman,
> From the loose woman who has flattered you with her words;
###### 17
> Who leaves the husband from her younger days,
> And has ignored her marriage covenant made before God.
###### 18
> For she has set her house by death,
> And her paths by the place of the departed spirits.
###### 19
> None who go in to her will return,
> Nor will they reach the paths of life.
###### 20
> So you will walk in the way of good people,
> And will keep on the paths of the righteous.
###### 21
> For the upright will reside in the land,
> And those with integrity will remain in it,
###### 22
> But the wicked will be removed from the land,
> And the treacherous will be torn away from it.
