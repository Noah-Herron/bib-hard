# Ecclesiastes 10
###### ¶ 1
> One dead fly makes the perfumer’s ointment give off a rancid stench,
> So a little folly can outweigh much wisdom.
## Wisdom Can Be Nullified By the Caprice of Rulers
###### 2
> A wise person’s good sense protects him,
> But a fool’s lack of sense leaves him vulnerable.
###### 3
> Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense,
> And shows everyone what a fool he is.
###### 4
> If the anger of the ruler flares up against you, do not resign from your position,
> For a calm response can undo great offenses.
###### ¶ 5
> I have seen another misfortune on the earth:
> It is an error a ruler makes.
###### 6
> Fools are placed in many positions of authority,
> While wealthy men sit in lowly positions.
###### 7
> I have seen slaves on horseback
> And princes walking on foot like slaves.
## Wisdom is Needed to Avert Dangers in Everyday Life
###### ¶ 8
> One who digs a pit may fall into it,
> And one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
###### 9
> One who quarries stones may be injured by them;
> One who splits logs may be endangered by them.
###### 10
> If an iron axhead is blunt and a workman does not sharpen its edge,
> He must exert a great deal of effort;
> So wisdom has the advantage of giving success.
###### 11
> If the snake should bite before it is charmed,
> The snake charmer is in trouble.
## Words and Works of Wise Men and Fools
###### 12
> The words of a wise person win him favor,
> But the words of a fool are self-destructive.
###### 13
> At the beginning his words are foolish
> And at the end his talk is wicked madness,
###### 14
> Yet a fool keeps on babbling.
> No one knows what will happen;
> Who can tell him what will happen in the future?
###### 15
> The toil of a stupid fool wears him out,
> Because he does not even know the way to the city.
## The Problem with Foolish Rulers
###### 16
> Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish,
> And your princes feast in the morning.
###### 17
> Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility,
> And your princes feast at the proper time—with self-control and not in drunkenness.
###### 18
> Because of laziness the roof caves in,
> And because of idle hands the house leaks.
###### 19
> Feasts are made for laughter,
> And wine makes life merry,
> But money is the answer for everything.
###### 20
> Do not curse a king even in your thoughts,
> And do not curse the rich while in your bedroom;
> For a bird might report what you are thinking,
> Or some winged creature might repeat your words.
