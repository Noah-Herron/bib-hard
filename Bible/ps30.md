# Psalm 30
###### ¶ 1
> I will praise you, O LORD, for you lifted me up,
> And did not allow my enemies to gloat over me.
###### 2
> O LORD my God,
> I cried out to you and you healed me.
###### 3
> O LORD, you pulled me up from Sheol;
> You rescued me from among those descending into the grave.
###### 4
> Sing to the LORD, you faithful followers of his;
> Give thanks to his holy name.

> And his good favor restores one’s life.

> But joy arrives in the morning.
###### ¶ 6
> In my self-confidence I said,
> “I will never be shaken.”
###### 7

> Then you rejected me and I was terrified.
###### 8
> To you, O LORD, I cried out;
> I begged the Lord for mercy:
###### 9
> “What profit is there in taking my life,
> “In my descending into the Pit?
> “Can the dust of the grave praise you?
> “Can it declare your loyalty?
###### ¶ 10
> “Hear, O LORD, and have mercy on me.
> “O LORD, deliver me.”
###### 11
> Then you turned my lament into dancing;
> You removed my sackcloth and covered me with joy.
###### 12
> So now my heart will sing to you and not be silent;
> O LORD my God, I will always give thanks to you.
