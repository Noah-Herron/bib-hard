## The Description of Leviathan
###### ¶ 1
>  “Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook,

###### 2
>  “ Can you put a cord through its nose,
>  “ Or pierce its jaw with a hook?
###### 3
>  “ Will it make numerous supplications to you,
>  “ Will it speak to you with tender words?
###### 4
>  “ Will it make a pact with you,
>  “ So you could take it as your slave for life?
###### 5
>  “ Can you play with it, like a bird,
>  “ Or tie it on a leash for your girls?
###### 6
>  “ Will partners bargain for it?
>  “ Will they divide it up among the merchants?
###### 7
>  “ Can you fill its hide with harpoons
>  “ Or its head with fishing spears?
###### 8
>  “ If you lay your hand on it,
>  “ You will remember the fight.
>  “ Do not do it again!
###### 9
>  “ 41:”
## 1 See, his expectation is wrong,
>  “ He is laid low even at the sight of it.
###### 10
>  “ Is it not fierce when it is awakened?
>  “ Who is he, then, who can stand before it?
###### 11
>  “ Who has confronted me that I should repay?
>  “ Everything under heaven belongs to me!
###### ¶ 12
>  “ I will not keep silent about its limbs,
>  “ And the extent of its might,
>  “ And the grace of its arrangement.
###### 13
>  “ Who can uncover its outer covering?
>  “ Who can penetrate to the inside of its armor?
###### 14
>  “ Who can open the doors of its mouth?
>  “ Its teeth all around are fearsome.
###### 15
>  “ Its back has rows of shields,
>  “ Shut up closely together as with a seal;
###### 16
>  “ Each one is so close to the next
>  “ That no air can come between them.
###### 17
>  “ They lock tightly together, one to the next;
>  “ They cling together and cannot be separated.
###### 18
>  “ Its snorting throws out flashes of light;
>  “ Its eyes are like the red glow of dawn.
###### 19
>  “ Out of its mouth go flames,
>  “ Sparks of fire shoot forth!
###### 20
>  “ Smoke streams from its nostrils
>  “ As from a boiling pot over burning rushes.
###### 21
>  “ Its breath sets coals ablaze
>  “ And a flame shoots from its mouth.
###### 22
>  “ Strength lodges in its neck,
>  “ And despair runs before it.
###### 23
>  “ The folds of its flesh are tightly joined;
>  “ They are firm on it, immovable.
###### 24
>  “ Its heart is hard as rock,
>  “ Hard as a lower millstone.
###### 25
>  “ When it rises up, the mighty are terrified,
>  “ At its thrashing about they withdraw.
###### 26
>  “ Whoever strikes it with a sword
>  “ Will have no effect,
>  “ Nor with the spear, arrow, or dart.
###### 27
>  “ It regards iron as straw
>  “ And bronze as rotten wood.
###### 28
>  “ Arrows do not make it flee;
>  “ Slingstones become like chaff to it.
###### 29
>  “ A club is counted as a piece of straw;
>  “ It laughs at the rattling of the lance.
###### 30
>  “ Its underparts are the sharp points of potsherds,
>  “ It leaves its mark in the mud
>  “ Like a threshing sledge.
###### 31
>  “ It makes the deep boil like a cauldron
>  “ And stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment,
###### 32
>  “ It leaves a glistening wake behind it;
>  “ One would think the deep had a head of white hair.
###### 33
>  “ The likes of it is not on earth,
>  “ A creature without fear.
###### 34
>  “ It looks on every haughty being;
>  “ It is king over all that are proud.”
