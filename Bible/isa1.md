# Isaiah 1
## Heading
###### ¶ 1
Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah reigned over Judah.
## Obedience, not Sacrifice
###### 2
> Listen, O heavens,
> Pay attention, O earth!
> For the LORD speaks:
>  “ I raised children, I brought them up,
>  “ But they have rebelled against me!
###### 3
>  “ An ox recognizes its owner,
>  “ A donkey recognizes where its owner puts its food;
>  “ But Israel does not recognize me,
>  “ My people do not understand.”
###### ¶ 4
> Beware sinful nation,
> The people weighed down by evil deeds.
> They are offspring who do wrong,
> Children who do wicked things.
> They have abandoned the LORD,
> And rejected the Holy One of Israel.
> They are alienated from him.
###### ¶ 5
> Why do you insist on being battered?
> Why do you continue to rebel?
> Your head has a massive wound,
> Your whole heart is sick.
###### 6
> From the soles of your feet to your head,
> There is no spot that is unharmed.
> There are only bruises, cuts,
> And open wounds.
> They have not been cleansed or bandaged,
> Nor have they been treated with olive oil.
###### ¶ 7
> Your land is devastated,
> Your cities burned with fire.
> Right before your eyes your crops
> Are being destroyed by foreign invaders.
> They leave behind devastation and destruction.
###### 8
> Daughter Zion is left isolated,
> Like a hut in a vineyard,
> Or a shelter in a cucumber field;
> She is a besieged city.
###### 9
> If the LORD of Heaven’s Armies had not left us a few survivors,
> We would have quickly been like Sodom,
> We would have become like Gomorrah.
###### ¶ 10
> Listen to the LORD’s message,
> You leaders of Sodom!
> Pay attention to our God’s rebuke,
> People of Gomorrah!
###### 11
>  “ Of what importance to me are your many sacrifices?”
> Says the LORD.
>  “ I have had my fill of burnt sacrifices,
>  “ Of rams and the fat from steers.
>  “ The blood of bulls, lambs, and goats
>  “ I do not want.
###### 12
>  “ When you enter my presence,
>  “ Do you actually think I want this—
>  “ Animals trampling on my courtyards?
###### 13
>  “ Do not bring any more meaningless offerings;
>  “ I consider your incense detestable!
>  “ You observe new moon festivals, Sabbaths, and convocations,
>  “ But I cannot tolerate sin-stained celebrations!
###### 14
>  “ I hate your new moon festivals and assemblies;
>  “ They are a burden
>  “ That I am tired of carrying.
###### 15
>  “ When you spread out your hands in prayer,
>  “ I look the other way;
>  “ When you offer your many prayers,
>  “ I do not listen,
>  “ Because your hands are covered with blood.
###### ¶ 16
>  “ Wash! Cleanse yourselves!
>  “ Remove your sinful deeds
>  “ From my sight.
>  “ Stop sinning.
###### 17
>  “ Learn to do what is right.
>  “ Promote justice.
>  “ Give the oppressed reason to celebrate.
>  “ Take up the cause of the orphan.
>  “ Defend the rights of the widow.
###### ¶ 18
>  “ Come, let’s consider your options,” says the LORD.
>  “ Though your sins have stained you like the color red,
>  “ You can become white like snow;
>  “ Though they are as easy to see as the color scarlet,
>  “ You can become white like wool.
###### 19
>  “ If you have a willing attitude and obey,
>  “ Then you will again eat the good crops of the land.
###### 20
>  “ But if you refuse and rebel,
>  “ You will be devoured by the sword.”
> Know for certain that the LORD has spoken.
## Purifying Judgment
###### ¶ 21
> How tragic that the once-faithful city
> Has become a prostitute!
> She was once a center of justice;
> Fairness resided in her—
> But now only murderers!
###### 22
> Your silver has become scum,
> Your beer is diluted with water.
###### 23
> Your officials are rebels,
> They associate with thieves.
> All of them love bribery,
> And look for payoffs.
> They do not take up the cause of the orphan,
> Or defend the rights of the widow.
###### ¶ 24
> Therefore, the Sovereign LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> The Powerful One of Israel, says this:
>  “ Ah, I will seek vengeance against my adversaries,
>  “ I will take revenge against my enemies.
###### 25
>  “ I will attack you;
>  “ I will purify your metal with flux.
>  “ I will remove all your slag.
###### 26
>  “ I will reestablish honest judges as in former times,
>  “ Wise advisers as in earlier days.
>  “ Then you will be called, ‘The Just City,
>  ‘ Faithful Town.’”
###### ¶ 27
> Zion will be freed by justice,
> And her returnees by righteousness.
###### 28
> All rebellious sinners will be shattered,
> Those who abandon the LORD will perish.
###### 29
> Indeed, they will be ashamed of the sacred trees
> You find so desirable;
> You will be embarrassed because of the sacred orchards
> Where you choose to worship.
###### 30
> For you will be like a tree whose leaves wither,
> Like an orchard that is unwatered.
###### 31
> The powerful will be like a thread of yarn,
> Their deeds like a spark;
> Both will burn together,
> And no one will put out the fire.
