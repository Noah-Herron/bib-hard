# Ecclesiastes 3
## A Time for All Events in Life
###### ¶ 1
> For everything there is an appointed time,
> And an appropriate time for every activity on earth:
###### 2
> A time to be born, and a time to die;
> A time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;
###### 3
> A time to kill, and a time to heal;
> A time to break down, and a time to build up;
###### 4
> A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
> A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
###### 5
> A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones;
> A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
###### 6
> A time to search, and a time to give something up as lost;
> A time to keep, and a time to throw away;
###### 7
> A time to rip, and a time to sew;
> A time to keep silent, and a time to speak.
###### 8
> A time to love, and a time to hate;
> A time for war, and a time for peace.
## Man is Ignorant of God’s Timing
###### ¶ 9
> What benefit can a worker gain from his toil?
###### 10
> I have observed the burden
> That God has given to people to keep them occupied.
###### 11
> God has made everything fit beautifully in its appropriate time,
> But he has also placed ignorance in the human heart
> So that people cannot discover what God has ordained,
> From the beginning to the end of their lives.
## Enjoy Life in the Present
###### ¶ 12
> I have concluded that there is nothing better for people
> Than to be happy and to enjoy
> Themselves as long as they live,
###### 13
> And also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil,
> For these things are a gift from God.
## God’s Sovereignty
###### 14
> I also know that whatever God does will endure forever;
> Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it.
> God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.
###### 15
> Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been;
> For God will seek to do again what has occurred in the past.
## The Problem of Injustice and Oppression
###### ¶ 16
> I saw something else on earth:
> In the place of justice, there was wickedness,
> And in the place of fairness, there was wickedness.
###### 17
> I thought to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked;
>  “ For there is an appropriate time for every activity,
>  “ And there is a time of judgment for every deed.”
###### 18
> I also thought to myself, “It is for the sake of people,
>  “ So God can clearly show them that they are like animals.
###### 19
>  “ For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same:
>  “ As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.
>  “ There is no advantage for humans over animals,
>  “ For both are fleeting.
###### 20
>  “ Both go to the same place,
>  “ Both come from the dust,
>  “ And to dust both return.
###### 21
>  “ Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward,
>  “ And the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?”
###### 22
> So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work,
> Because that is their reward;
> For who can show them what the future holds?
