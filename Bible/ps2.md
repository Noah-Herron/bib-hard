# Psalm 2
###### ¶ 1
> Why do the nations rebel?
> Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?
###### 2
> The kings of the earth form a united front;
> The rulers collaborate
> Against the LORD and his anointed king.
###### 3
> They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us.
>  “ Let’s free ourselves from their ropes.”
###### ¶ 4
> The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust;
> The Lord taunts them.
###### 5
> Then he angrily speaks to them
> And terrifies them in his rage, saying,
###### 6
>  “ I myself have installed my king
>  “ On Zion, my holy hill.”
###### ¶ 7
> The king says, “I will announce the LORD’s decree. He said to me:
>  ‘ You are my son. This very day I have become your father.
###### 8
>  ‘ Ask me,
>  ‘ And I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
>  ‘ The ends of the earth as your personal property.
###### 9
>  ‘ You will break them with an iron scepter;
>  ‘ You will smash them like a potter’s jar.’”
###### ¶ 10
> So now, you kings, do what is wise;
> You rulers of the earth, submit to correction.
###### 11
> Serve the LORD in fear.
> Repent in terror.
###### 12
> Give sincere homage.
> Otherwise he will be angry,
> And you will die because of your behavior,
> When his anger quickly ignites.
> How blessed are all who take shelter in him!
