## Job Regrets His Birth
###### ¶ 1
After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.
###### 2
Job spoke up and said:
###### 3
> “Let the day on which I was born perish,
> “And the night that said,
> ‘A man has been conceived!’
###### 4
> “That day—let it be darkness;
> “Let not God on high regard it,
> “Nor let light shine on it!
###### 5
> “Let darkness and the deepest shadow claim it;
> “Let a cloud settle on it;
> “Let whatever blackens the day terrify it.
###### 6
> “That night—let darkness seize it;
> “Let it not be included among the days of the year;
> “Let it not enter among the number of the months!
###### 7
> “Indeed, let that night be barren;
> “Let no shout of joy penetrate it!
###### 8
> “Let those who curse the day curse it—
> “Those who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.
###### 9
> “Let its morning stars be darkened;
> “Let it wait for daylight but find none,
> “Nor let it see the first rays of dawn,
###### 10
> “Because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb on me,
> “Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.”
## Job Wishes He Had Died at Birth
###### ¶ 11
> “Why did I not die at birth,
> “And why did I not expire
> “As I came out of the womb?
###### 12
> “Why did the knees welcome me,
> “And why were there two breasts
> “That I might nurse at them?
###### 13
> “For now I would be lying down
> “And would be quiet,
> “I would be asleep and then at peace
###### 14
> “With kings and counselors of the earth
> “Who built for themselves places now desolate,
###### 15
> “Or with princes who possessed gold,
> “Who filled their palaces with silver.
###### 16
> “Or why was I not buried
> “Like a stillborn infant,
> “Like infants who have never seen the light?
###### 17
> “There the wicked cease from turmoil,
> “And there the weary are at rest.
###### 18
> “There the prisoners relax together;
> “They do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
###### 19
> “Small and great are there,
> “And the slave is free from his master.”
## Longing for Death
###### ¶ 20
> “Why does God give light to one who is in misery,
> “And life to those whose soul is bitter,
###### 21
> “To those who wait for death that does not come,
> “And search for it
> “More than for hidden treasures,
###### 22
> “Who rejoice even to jubilation,
> “And are exultant when they find the grave?
###### 23
> “Why is light given to a man
> “Whose way is hidden,
> “And whom God has hedged in?
###### 24
> “For my sighing comes in place of my food,
> “And my groanings flow forth like water.
###### 25
> “For the very thing I dreaded has happened to me,
> “And what I feared has come upon me.
###### 26
> “I have no ease, I have no quietness;
> “I cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me.”
