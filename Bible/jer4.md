# Jeremiah 4
###### ¶ 1
>  “ If you, Israel, want to come back,” says the LORD,
>  “ If you want to come back to me,
>  “ You must get those disgusting idols out of my sight
>  “ And must no longer go astray.
###### 2
>  “ You must be truthful, honest, and upright
>  “ When you take an oath saying, ‘As surely as the LORD lives!’
>  “ If you do, the nations will pray to be as blessed by him as you are
>  “ And will make him the object of their boasting.”
###### ¶ 3
> Yes, this is what the LORD has said
> To the people of Judah and Jerusalem:
>  “ Break up your unplowed ground, do not cast seeds among thorns.
###### 4
>  “ Commit yourselves to the LORD;
>  “ Dedicate your hearts to me
>  “ People of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem.
>  “ Otherwise, my anger will blaze up like a flaming fire against you
>  “ That no one will be able to extinguish.
>  “ That will happen because of the evil you have done.”
## Warning of Coming Judgment
###### ¶ 5
The LORD said,
>  “ Announce this in Judah and proclaim it in Jerusalem:
>  ‘ Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’
>  “ Shout out loudly,
>  ‘ Gather together! Let us flee into the fortified cities!’
###### 6
>  “ Raise a signal flag that tells people to go to Zion.
>  “ Run for safety! Do not delay!
>  “ For I am about to bring disaster out of the north.
>  “ It will bring great destruction.
###### 7
>  “ Like a lion that has come up from its lair
>  “ The one who destroys nations has set out from his home base.
>  “ He is coming out to lay your land waste.
>  “ Your cities will become ruins and lie uninhabited.
###### 8
>  “ So put on sackcloth!
>  “ Mourn and wail, saying,
>  ‘ The fierce anger of the LORD
>  ‘ Has not turned away from us!’
###### 9
>  “ When this happens,” says the LORD,
>  “ The king and his officials will lose their courage.
>  “ The priests will be struck with horror,
>  “ And the prophets will be speechless in astonishment.”
###### ¶ 10
In response to all this I said, “Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have surely allowed the people of Judah and Jerusalem to be deceived by those who say, ‘You will be safe!’ But in fact a sword is already at our throats.”
###### ¶ 11
> At that time the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be told,
>  “ A scorching wind will sweep down
>  “ From the hilltops in the wilderness on my dear people.
>  “ It will not be a gentle breeze
>  “ For winnowing the grain and blowing away the chaff.
###### 12
>  “ No, a wind too strong for that will come at my bidding.
>  “ Yes, even now I, myself, am calling down judgment on them.
###### 13
>  “ Look! The enemy is approaching like gathering clouds.
>  “ The roar of his chariots is like that of a whirlwind.
>  “ His horses move more swiftly than eagles.”
> I cry out, “We are doomed, for we will be destroyed!”
###### ¶ 14
> O people of Jerusalem, purify your hearts from evil
> So that you may yet be delivered.
> How long will you continue to harbor up
> Wicked schemes within you?
###### 15
> For messengers are coming, heralding disaster,
> From the city of Dan and from the hills of Ephraim.
###### 16
> They are saying,
>  “ Announce to the surrounding nations,
>  ‘ The enemy is coming!’
>  “ Proclaim this message to Jerusalem:
>  ‘ Those who besiege cities are coming from a distant land.
>  ‘ They are ready to raise the battle cry against the towns in Judah.’
###### 17
>  “ They will surround Jerusalem
>  “ Like men guarding a field
>  “ Because they have rebelled against me,”
> Says the LORD.
###### 18
>  “ The way you have lived and the things you have done
>  “ Will bring this on you.
>  “ This is the punishment you deserve, and it will be painful indeed.
>  “ The pain will be so bad it will pierce your heart.”
###### ¶ 19
I said,
>  “ Oh, the feeling in the pit of my stomach!
>  “ I writhe in anguish.
>  “ Oh, the pain in my heart!
>  “ My heart pounds within me.
>  “ I cannot keep silent.
>  “ For I hear the sound of the trumpet;
>  “ The sound of the battle cry pierces my soul!
###### 20
>  “ I see one destruction after another taking place,
>  “ So that the whole land lies in ruins.
>  “ I see our tents suddenly destroyed,
>  “ Their curtains torn down in a mere instant.
###### 21
>  “ How long must I see the enemy’s battle flags
>  “ And hear the military signals of their bugles?”
###### 22
The LORD answered,
>  “ This will happen because my people are foolish.
>  “ They do not know me.
>  “ They are like children who have no sense.
>  “ They have no understanding.
>  “ They are skilled at doing evil.
>  “ They do not know how to do good.”
###### ¶ 23
> I looked at the land and saw that it was an empty wasteland.
> I looked up at the sky, and its light had vanished.
###### 24
> I looked at the mountains and saw that they were shaking.
> All the hills were swaying back and forth!
###### 25
> I looked and saw that there were no more people
> And that all the birds in the sky had flown away.
###### 26
> I looked and saw that the fruitful land had become a desert
> And that all the cities had been laid in ruins.
> The LORD had brought this all about
> Because of his blazing anger.
###### ¶ 27
> All this will happen because the LORD said,
>  “ The whole land will be desolate;
>  “ However, I will not completely destroy it.
###### 28
>  “ Because of this the land will mourn
>  “ And the sky above will grow black.
>  “ For I have made my purpose known,
>  “ And I will not relent or turn back from carrying it out.”
###### 29
> At the sound of the approaching horsemen and archers
> The people of every town will flee.
> Some of them will hide in the thickets.
> Others will climb up among the rocks.
> All the cities will be deserted.
> No one will remain in them.
###### 30
> And you, Zion, city doomed to destruction,
> You accomplish nothing by wearing a beautiful dress,
> Decking yourself out in jewels of gold,
> And putting on eye shadow!
> You are making yourself beautiful for nothing.
> Your lovers spurn you.
> They want to kill you.
###### 31
> In fact, I hear a cry like that of a woman in labor,
> A cry of anguish like that of a woman giving birth to her first baby.
> It is the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath,
> Reaching out for help, saying, “I am done in!
>  “ My life is ebbing away before these murderers!”
