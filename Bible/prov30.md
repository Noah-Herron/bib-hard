# Proverbs 30
## The Words of Agur
###### ¶ 1
> The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle:
> This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:
###### 2
> Surely I am more brutish than any other human being,
> And I do not have human understanding;
###### 3
> I have not learned wisdom,
> Nor can I have knowledge of the Holy One.
###### 4
> Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?
> Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?
> Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?
> Who has established all the ends of the earth?
> What is his name, and what is his son’s name? Surely you can know!
###### ¶ 5
> Every word of God is purified;
> He is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.
###### 6
> Do not add to his words,
> Lest he reprove you, and prove you to be a liar.
###### ¶ 7
> Two things I have asked from you;
> Do not refuse me before I die:
###### 8
> Remove falsehood and lies far from me;
> Do not give me poverty or riches,
> Feed me with my allotted portion of bread,
###### 9
> Lest I become satisfied and act deceptively
> And say, “Who is the LORD?”
> Or lest I become poor and steal
> And demean the name of my God.
###### ¶ 10
> Do not slander a servant to his master,
> Lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.
###### ¶ 11
> There is a generation who curse their fathers
> And do not bless their mothers.
###### 12
> There is a generation who are pure in their own opinion
> And yet are not washed from their filthiness.
###### 13
> There is a generation whose eyes are so lofty,
> And whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully.
###### 14
> There is a generation whose teeth are like swords
> And whose molars are like knives
> To devour the poor from the earth
> And the needy from among the human race.
###### ¶ 15
> The leech has two daughters:
> “Give! Give!”
> There are three things that will never be satisfied,
> Four that have never said, “Enough”—
###### 16
> The grave, the barren womb;
> Earth has not been satisfied with water;
> And fire has never said, “Enough!”
###### 17
> The eye that mocks at a father
> And despises obeying a mother—
> The ravens of the valley will peck it out
> And the young vultures will eat it.
###### ¶ 18
> There are three things that are too wonderful for me,
> Four that I do not understand:
###### 19
> The way of an eagle in the sky,
> The way of a snake on a rock,
> The way of a ship in the sea,
> And the way of a man with a woman.
###### 20
> This is the way of an adulterous woman:
> She has eaten and wiped her mouth
> And has said, “I have not done wrong.”
###### ¶ 21
> Under three things the earth has trembled,
> And under four things it cannot bear up:
###### 22
> Under a servant who becomes king,
> Under a fool who becomes stuffed with food,
###### 23
> Under an unloved woman who becomes married,
> And under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress.
###### ¶ 24
> There are four things on earth that are small,
> But they are exceedingly wise:
###### 25
> Ants are creatures with little strength,
> But they prepare their food in the summer;
###### 26
> Rock badgers are creatures with little power,
> But they make their homes in the crags;
###### 27
> Locusts have no king,
> But they all go forward by ranks;
###### 28
> A lizard you can catch with the hand,
> But it gets into the palaces of the king.
###### ¶ 29
> There are three things that are magnificent in their step,
> Four things that move about magnificently:
###### 30
> A lion, mightiest of the beasts,
> Who does not retreat from anything;
###### 31
> A strutting rooster, a male goat,
> And a king with his army around him.
###### ¶ 32
> If you have done foolishly by exalting yourself
> Or if you have planned evil,
> Put your hand over your mouth!
###### 33
> For as the churning of milk produces butter
> And as punching the nose produces blood,
> So stirring up anger produces strife.
