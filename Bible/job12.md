>  “ And wisdom will die with you.
###### 3

>  “ I am not inferior to you.
>  “ Who does not know such things as these?
###### 4
>  “ I am a laughingstock to my friends,
>  “ I, who called on God and whom he answered—
>  “ A righteous and blameless man
>  “ Is a laughingstock!
###### 5
>  “ For calamity, there is derision
>  “ (according to the ideas of the fortunate)—

>  “ And those who provoke God are confident—
>  “ Who carry their god in their hands.”

>  “ Or the birds of the sky and they will tell you.

###### 11
