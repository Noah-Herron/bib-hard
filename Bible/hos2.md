# Hosea 2
###### ¶ 1
Then you will call your brother, “My People” (Ammi)! You will call your sister, “Pity” (Ruhamah)!
## Idolatrous Israel Will Be Punished Like a Prostitute
###### 2
> “Plead earnestly with your mother
> “(for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband),
> “So that she might put an end to her adulterous lifestyle,
> “And turn away from her sexually immoral behavior.
###### 3
> “Otherwise, I will strip her naked,
> “And expose her like she was when she was born.
> “I will turn her land into a wilderness
> “And make her country a parched land,
> “So that I might kill her with thirst.
###### 4
> “I will have no pity on her children,
> “Because they are children conceived in adultery.
###### 5
> “For their mother has committed adultery;
> “She who conceived them has acted shamefully.
> “For she said, “I will seek out my lovers;
> “They are the ones who give me my bread and my water,
> “My wool, my flax, my olive oil, and my wine.”
## The Lord’s Discipline Will Bring Israel Back
###### 6
> “Therefore, I will soon fence her in with thorns;
> “I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
###### 7
> “Then she will pursue her lovers, but she will not catch them;
> “She will seek them, but she will not find them.
> “Then she will say,
> ‘I will go back to my husband,
> ‘Because I was better off then than I am now.’
## Agricultural Fertility Withdrawn from Israel
###### ¶ 8
> “Yet until now she has refused to acknowledge that I was the one
> “Who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil;
> “And that it was I who lavished on her the silver and gold—
> “That they used in worshiping Baal!
###### 9
> “Therefore, I will take back my grain during the harvest time
> “And my new wine when it ripens;
> “I will take away my wool and my flax
> “That I had provided in order to clothe her.
###### 10
> “Soon I will expose her lewd nakedness in front of her lovers,
> “And no one will be able to rescue her from me!
###### 11
> “I will put an end to all her celebrations:
> “Her annual religious festivals,
> “Monthly new moon celebrations,
> “And weekly Sabbath festivities—
> “All her appointed festivals.
###### 12
> “I will destroy her vines and fig trees,
> “About which she said, ‘These are my wages for prostitution
> ‘That my lovers gave to me!’
> “I will turn her cultivated vines and fig trees into an uncultivated thicket,
> “So that wild animals will devour them.
###### 13
> “I will punish her for the festival days
> “When she burned incense to the Baal idols;
> “She adorned herself with earrings and jewelry,
> “And went after her lovers,
> “But she forgot me!” says the LORD.
## Future Repentance and Restoration of Israel
###### ¶ 14
> “However, in the future I will allure her;
> “I will lead her back into the wilderness,
> “And speak tenderly to her.
###### 15
> “From there I will give back her vineyards to her,
> “And turn the ‘Valley of Trouble’ into an ‘Opportunity for Hope.’
> “There she will sing as she did when she was young,
> “When she came up from the land of Egypt.
###### 16
> “At that time,” declares the LORD,
> “You will call, ‘My husband’;
> “You will never again call me, ‘My master.’
###### 17
> “For I will remove the names of the Baal idols from your lips,
> “So that you will never again utter their names!”
## New Covenant Relationship with Repentant Israel
###### 18
> “At that time I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals,
> “The birds of the air, and the creatures that crawl on the ground.
> “I will abolish the warrior’s bow and sword—
> “That is, every weapon of warfare—from the land,
> “And I will allow them to live securely.
###### 19

> “I will commit myself to you in righteousness and justice,
> “In steadfast love and tender compassion.
###### 20

## Agricultural Fertility Restored to the Repentant Nation
###### ¶ 21

> “And the sky will respond to the ground;
###### 22

> “And they will respond to ‘God Plants’ (Jezreel)!
###### 23
