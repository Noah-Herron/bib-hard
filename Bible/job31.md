# Job 31
## Job Vindicates Himself
###### ¶ 1
> “I made a covenant with my eyes;
> “How then could I entertain thoughts against a virgin?
###### 2
> “What then would be one’s lot from God above,
> “One’s heritage from the Almighty on high?
###### 3
> “Is it not misfortune for the unjust,
> “And disaster for those who work iniquity?
###### 4
> “Does he not see my ways
> “And count all my steps?
###### ¶ 5
> “If I have walked in falsehood,
> “And if my foot has hastened to deceit—
###### 6
> “Let him weigh me with honest scales;
> “Then God will discover my integrity.
###### 7
> “If my footsteps have strayed from the way,
> “If my heart has gone after my eyes,
> “Or if anything has defiled my hands,
###### 8
> “Then let me sow and let another eat,
> “And let my crops be uprooted.
###### ¶ 9
> “If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
> “And I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door,
###### 10
> “Then let my wife turn the millstone for another man,
> “And may other men commit adultery with her.
###### 11
> “For I would have committed a shameful act,
> “An iniquity to be judged.
###### 12
> “For it is a fire that devours even to Destruction,
> “And it would uproot all my harvest.
###### ¶ 13
> “If I have disregarded the right of my male servants
> “Or my female servants
> “When they disputed with me,
###### 14
> “Then what will I do when God confronts me in judgment;
> “When he intervenes,
> “How will I respond to him?
###### 15
> “Did not the one who made me in the womb make them?
> “Did not the same one form us in the womb?
###### ¶ 16
> “If I have refused to give the poor what they desired,
> “Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
###### 17
> “If I ate my morsel of bread myself,
> “And did not share any of it with orphans—
###### 18
> “But from my youth I raised the orphan like a father,
> “And from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—
###### 19
> “If I have seen anyone about to perish for lack of clothing,
> “Or a poor man without a coat,
###### 20
> “Whose heart did not bless me
> “As he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep,
###### 21
> “If I have raised my hand to vote against the orphan,
> “When I saw my support in the court,
###### 22
> “Then let my arm fall from the shoulder,
> “Let my arm be broken off at the socket.
###### 23
> “For the calamity from God was a terror to me,
> “And by reason of his majesty I was powerless.
###### ¶ 24
> “If I have put my confidence in gold
> “Or said to pure gold,
> ‘You are my security!’
###### 25
> “If I have rejoiced because of the extent of my wealth,
> “Or because of the great wealth my hand had gained,
###### 26
> “If I looked at the sun when it was shining,
> “And the moon advancing as a precious thing,
###### 27
> “So that my heart was secretly enticed,
> “And my hand threw them a kiss from my mouth,
###### 28
> “Then this also would be iniquity to be judged,
> “For I would have been false to God above.
###### ¶ 29
> “If I have rejoiced over the misfortune of my enemy
> “Or exulted because calamity found him—
###### 30
> “I have not even permitted my mouth to sin
> “By asking for his life through a curse—
###### 31
> “If the members of my household have never said,
> ‘If only there were someone
> ‘Who has not been satisfied from Job’s meat!’—
###### 32
> “But no stranger had to spend the night outside,
> “For I opened my doors to the traveler—
###### 33
> “If I have covered my transgressions as men do,
> “By hiding iniquity in my heart,
###### 34
> “Because I was terrified of the great multitude,
> “And the contempt of families terrified me,
> “So that I remained silent
> “And would not go outdoors—”
## Job’s Appeal
###### 35
> “If only I had someone to hear me!
> “Here is my signature—
> “Let the Almighty answer me!
> “If only I had an indictment
> “That my accuser had written.
###### 36
> “Surely I would wear it proudly on my shoulder,
> “I would bind it on me like a crown;
###### 37
> “I would give him an accounting of my steps;
> “Like a prince I would draw near to him.”
## Job’s Final Solemn Oath
###### ¶ 38
> “If my land cried out against me
> “And all its furrows wept together,
###### 39
> “If I have eaten its produce without paying,
> “Or caused the death of its owners,
###### 40
> “Then let thorns sprout up in place of wheat,
> “And in place of barley, noxious weeds.”
The words of Job are ended.
