# Isaiah 28
## The Lord Will Judge Ephraim
###### ¶ 1
> The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards is doomed,
> The withering flower, its beautiful splendor,
> Situated at the head of a rich valley,
> The crown of those overcome with wine.
###### 2
> Look, the Lord sends a strong, powerful one.
> With the force of a hailstorm or a destructive windstorm,
> With the might of a driving, torrential rainstorm,
> He will knock that crown to the ground with his hand.
###### 3
> The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards
> Will be trampled underfoot.
###### 4
> The withering flower, its beautiful splendor,
> Situated at the head of a rich valley,
> Will be like an early fig before harvest—
> As soon as someone notices it,
> He grabs it and swallows it.
###### 5
> At that time the LORD of Heaven’s Armies will become a beautiful crown
> And a splendid diadem for the remnant of his people.
###### 6
> He will give discernment to the one who makes judicial decisions,
> And strength to those who defend the city from attackers.
###### 7
> Even these men stagger because of wine;
> They stumble around because of beer—
> Priests and prophets stagger because of beer,
> They are confused because of wine,
> They stumble around because of beer;
> They stagger while seeing prophetic visions,
> They totter while making legal decisions.
###### 8
> Indeed, all the tables
> Are covered with vomit,
> With filth, leaving no clean place.
###### ¶ 9
> Who is the LORD trying to teach?
> To whom is he explaining a message?
> To those just weaned from milk!
> To those just taken from their mother’s breast!
###### 10
> Indeed, they will hear meaningless gibberish,
> Senseless babbling,
> A syllable here, a syllable there.
###### 11
> For with mocking lips and a foreign tongue
> He will speak to these people.
###### 12
> In the past he said to them,
>  “ This is where security can be found.
>  “ Provide security for the one who is exhausted.
>  “ This is where rest can be found.”
> But they refused to listen.
###### 13
> So the LORD’s message to them will sound like
> Meaningless gibberish,
> Senseless babbling,
> A syllable here, a syllable there.
> As a result, they will fall on their backsides when they try to walk,
> And be injured, ensnared, and captured.
## The Lord Will Judge Jerusalem
###### 14
> Therefore, listen to the LORD’s message,
> You who mock,
> You rulers of these people
> Who reside in Jerusalem.
###### 15
> For you say,
>  “ We have made a treaty with death,
>  “ With Sheol we have made an agreement.
>  “ When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by
>  “ It will not reach us.
>  “ For we have made a lie our refuge,
>  “ We have hidden ourselves in a deceitful word.”
###### 16
> Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD, says:
>  “ Look, I am laying a stone in Zion,
>  “ An approved stone,
>  “ Set in place as a precious cornerstone for the foundation.
>  “ The one who maintains his faith will not panic.
###### 17
>  “ I will make justice the measuring line,
>  “ Fairness the plumb line;
>  “ Hail will sweep away the unreliable refuge,
>  “ The floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place.
###### 18
>  “ Your treaty with death will be dissolved;
>  “ Your agreement with Sheol will not last.
>  “ When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by,
>  “ You will be overrun by it.
###### 19
>  “ Whenever it sweeps by, it will overtake you;
>  “ Indeed, every morning it will sweep by,
>  “ It will come through during the day and the night.”
> When this announcement is understood,
> It will cause nothing but terror.
###### 20
> For the bed is too short to stretch out on,
> And the blanket is too narrow to wrap around oneself.
###### 21
> For the LORD will rise up, as he did at Mount Perazim;
> He will rouse himself, as he did in the Valley of Gibeon,
> To accomplish his work,
> His peculiar work,
> To perform his task,
> His strange task.
###### 22
> So now, do not mock,
> Or your chains will become heavier!
> For I have heard a message about decreed destruction,
> From the Sovereign LORD of Heaven’s Armies against the entire land.
###### ¶ 23
> Pay attention and listen to my message.
> Be attentive and listen to what I have to say!
###### 24
> Does a farmer just keep on plowing at planting time?
> Does he keep breaking up and harrowing his ground?
###### 25
> Once he has leveled its surface,
> Does he not scatter the seed of the caraway plant,
> Sow the seed of the cumin plant,
> And plant the wheat, barley, and grain in their designated places?
###### 26
> His God instructs him;
> He teaches him the principles of agriculture.
###### 27
> Certainly caraway seed is not threshed with a sledge,
> Nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin seed.
> Certainly caraway seed is beaten with a stick,
> And cumin seed with a flail.
###### 28
> Grain is crushed,
> Though one certainly does not thresh it forever.
> The wheel of one’s wagon rolls over it,
> But his horses do not crush it.
###### 29
> This also comes from the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> Who gives supernatural guidance and imparts great wisdom.
