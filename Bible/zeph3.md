# Zephaniah 3
## Jerusalem is Corrupt
###### ¶ 1
> Beware to the filthy, stained city;
> The city filled with oppressors!
###### 2
> She is disobedient;
> She has refused correction.
> She does not trust the LORD;
> She has not sought the advice of her God.
###### 3
> Her princes are as fierce as roaring lions;
> Her rulers are as hungry as wolves in the desert,
> Who completely devour their prey by morning.
###### 4
> Her prophets are proud;
> They are deceitful men.
> Her priests have defiled what is holy;
> They have broken God’s laws.
###### 5
> The just LORD resides within her;
> He commits no unjust acts.
> Every morning he reveals his justice.
> At dawn he appears without fail.
> Yet the unjust know no shame.
