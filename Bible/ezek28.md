## A Prophecy Against the King of Tyre
###### ¶ 1
The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
“Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
>  “ ‘Your heart is proud and you said, “I am a god;
>  ‘ I sit in the seat of gods, in the heart of the seas”—
>  ‘ Yet you are a man and not a god,
>  ‘ Though you think you are godlike.
###### 3
>  ‘ Look, you are wiser than Daniel;
>  ‘ No secret is hidden from you.
###### 4
>  ‘ By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself;
>  ‘ You have amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.
###### 5
>  ‘ By your great skill in trade you have increased your wealth,
>  ‘ And your heart is proud because of your wealth.
###### 6
>  “  ‘ Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says:
>  ‘ Because you think you are godlike,
###### 7
>  ‘ I am about to bring foreigners against you, the most terrifying of nations.
>  ‘ They will draw their swords against the grandeur made by your wisdom,
>  ‘ And they will defile your splendor.
###### 8
>  ‘ They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die violently in the heart of the seas.
###### 9
>  ‘ Will you still say, “I am a god,” before the one who kills you—
>  ‘ Though you are a man and not a god—
>  ‘ When you are in the power of those who wound you?
###### 10
>  ‘ You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners;
>  ‘ For I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”
###### ¶ 11
The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 12
“Son of man, sing a lament for the king of Tyre, and say to him, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
>  “ ‘You were the sealer of perfection,
>  ‘ Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
###### 13
>  ‘ You were in Eden, the garden of God.
>  ‘ Every precious stone was your covering,
>  ‘ The ruby, topaz, and emerald,
>  ‘ The chrysolite, onyx, and jasper,
>  ‘ The sapphire, turquoise, and beryl;
>  ‘ Your settings and mounts were made of gold.
>  ‘ On the day you were created they were prepared.
###### 14
>  ‘ I placed you there with an anointed guardian cherub;
>  ‘ You were on the holy mountain of God;
>  ‘ You walked about amidst fiery stones.
###### 15
>  ‘ You were blameless in your behavior from the day you were created,
>  ‘ Until sin was discovered in you.
###### 16
>  ‘ In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned;
>  ‘ So I defiled you and banished you from the mountain of God—
>  ‘ The guardian cherub expelled you from the midst of the stones of fire.
###### 17
>  ‘ Your heart was proud because of your beauty;
>  ‘ You corrupted your wisdom on account of your splendor.
>  ‘ I threw you down to the ground;
>  ‘ I placed you before kings, that they might see you.
###### 18
>  ‘ By the multitude of your iniquities, through the sinfulness of your trade,
>  ‘ You desecrated your sanctuaries.
>  ‘ So I drew fire out from within you;
>  ‘ It consumed you,
>  ‘ And I turned you to ashes on the earth
>  ‘ Before the eyes of all who saw you.
###### 19
>  ‘ All who know you among the peoples are shocked at you;
>  ‘ You have become terrified and will be no more.’”
## A Prophecy Against Sidon
###### ¶ 20
The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 21
“Son of man, turn toward Sidon and prophesy against it.
###### 22
“Say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says:
>  “ ‘Look, I am against you, Sidon,
>  ‘ And I will magnify myself in your midst.
>  ‘ Then they will know that I am the LORD
>  ‘ When I execute judgments on her
>  ‘ And reveal my sovereign power in her.
###### 23
>  ‘ I will send a plague into the city and bloodshed into its streets;
>  ‘ The slain will fall within it, by the sword that attacks it from every side.
>  ‘ Then they will know that I am the LORD.
###### 24
“‘No longer will Israel suffer from the sharp briers or painful thorns of all who surround and scorn them. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.
###### ¶ 25
“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When I regather the house of Israel from the peoples where they are dispersed, I will reveal my sovereign power over them in the sight of the nations, and they will live in their land that I gave to my servant Jacob.
###### 26
‘They will live securely in it; they will build houses and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute my judgments on all those who scorn them and surround them. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.’”
