# Habakkuk 1
## Habakkuk Complains to the Lord
###### ¶ 1
This is the oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw:
###### ¶ 2
> How long, LORD, must I cry for help?
> But you do not listen!
> I call out to you, “Violence!”
> But you do not deliver!
###### 3
> Why do you force me to witness injustice?
> Why do you put up with wrongdoing?
> Destruction and violence confront me;
> Conflict is present and one must endure strife.
###### 4
> For this reason the law lacks power,
> And justice is never carried out.
> Indeed, the wicked intimidate the innocent.
> For this reason justice is perverted.
## The Lord’s Surprising Answer
###### ¶ 5
>  “ Look at the nations and pay attention!
>  “ You will be shocked and amazed!
>  “ For I will do something in your lifetime
>  “ That you will not believe even though you are forewarned.
###### 6
>  “ Look, I am about to empower the Babylonians,
>  “ That ruthless and greedy nation.
>  “ They sweep across the surface of the earth,
>  “ Seizing dwelling places that do not belong to them.
###### 7
>  “ They are frightening and terrifying;
>  “ They decide for themselves what is right.
###### 8
>  “ Their horses are faster than leopards
>  “ And more alert than wolves in the desert.
>  “ Their horses gallop,
>  “ Their horses come a great distance;
>  “ Like vultures they swoop down quickly to devour their prey.
###### 9
>  “ All of them intend to do violence;
>  “ Every face is determined.
>  “ They take prisoners as easily as one scoops up sand.
###### 10
>  “ They mock kings
>  “ And laugh at rulers.
>  “ They laugh at every fortified city;
>  “ They build siege ramps and capture them.
###### 11
>  “ They sweep by like the wind and pass on.
>  “ But the one who considers himself a god will be held guilty.”
## Habakkuk Voices Some Concerns
###### ¶ 12
> LORD, you have been active from ancient times;
> My sovereign God, you are immortal.
> LORD, you have made them your instrument of judgment.
> Protector, you have appointed them as your instrument of punishment.
###### 13
> You are too just to tolerate evil;
> You are unable to condone wrongdoing.
> So why do you put up with such treacherous people?
> Why do you say nothing when the wicked devour those more righteous than they are?
###### 14
> You made people like fish in the sea,
> Like animals in the sea that have no ruler.
###### 15
> The Babylonian tyrant pulls them all up with a fishhook;
> He hauls them in with his throw net.
> When he catches them in his dragnet,
> He is very happy.
###### 16
> Because of his success he offers sacrifices to his throw net
> And burns incense to his dragnet;
> For because of them he has plenty of food,
> And more than enough to eat.
###### 17
> Will he then continue to fill and empty his throw net?
> Will he always destroy nations and spare none?
