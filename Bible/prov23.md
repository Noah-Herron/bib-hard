# Proverbs 23
###### ¶ 1
> When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
> Consider carefully what is before you,
###### 2
> And put a knife to your throat
> If you possess a large appetite.
###### 3
> Do not crave that ruler’s delicacies,
> For that food is deceptive.
###### ¶ 4
> Do not wear yourself out to become rich;
> Be wise enough to restrain yourself.
###### 5
> When you gaze upon riches, they are gone,
> For they surely make wings for themselves,
> And fly off into the sky like an eagle!
###### ¶ 6
> Do not eat the food of a stingy person,
> Do not crave his delicacies;
###### 7
> For he is like someone who has calculated the cost in his mind.
> “Eat and drink,” he says to you,
> But his heart is not with you;
###### 8
> You will vomit up the little bit you have eaten,
> And will have wasted your pleasant words.
###### ¶ 9
> Do not speak in the ears of a fool,
> For he will despise the wisdom of your words.
###### ¶ 10
> Do not move an ancient boundary stone,
> Or take over the fields of the fatherless,
###### 11
> For their Protector is strong;
> He will plead their case against you.
###### 12
> Apply your heart to instruction
> And your ears to the words of knowledge.
###### ¶ 13
> Do not withhold discipline from a child;
> Even if you strike him with the rod, he will not die.
###### 14
> If you strike him with the rod,
> You will deliver him from death.
###### ¶ 15
> My child, if your heart is wise,
> Then my heart also will be glad;
###### 16
> My soul will rejoice
> When your lips speak what is right.
###### ¶ 17
> Do not let your heart envy sinners,
> But rather be zealous in fearing the LORD all the time.
###### 18
> For surely there is a future,
> And your hope will not be cut off.
###### 19
> Listen, my child, and be wise,
> And guide your heart on the right way.
###### 20
> Do not spend time among drunkards,
> Among those who eat too much meat,
###### 21
> Because drunkards and gluttons become impoverished,
> And drowsiness clothes them with rags.
###### ¶ 22
> Listen to your father who gave you life,
> And do not despise your mother when she is old.
###### 23
> Acquire truth and do not sell it—
> Wisdom, and discipline, and understanding.
###### ¶ 24
> The father of a righteous person will rejoice greatly;
> Whoever fathers a wise child will have joy in him.
###### 25
> May your father and your mother have joy;
> May she who bore you rejoice.
###### ¶ 26
> Give me your heart, my son,
> And let your eyes observe my ways;
###### 27
> For a prostitute is like a deep pit;
> A harlot is like a narrow well.
###### 28
> Indeed, she lies in wait like a robber,
> And increases the unfaithful among men.
###### ¶ 29
> Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
> Who has contentions? Who has complaints?
> Who has wounds without cause? Who has dullness of the eyes?
###### 30
> Those who linger over wine,
> Those who go looking for mixed wine.
###### 31
> Do not look on the wine when it is red,
> When it sparkles in the cup,
> When it goes down smoothly.
###### 32
> Afterward it bites like a snake,
> And stings like a viper.
###### 33
> Your eyes will see strange things,
> And your mind will speak perverse things.
###### 34
> And you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
> And like one who lies down on the top of the rigging.
###### 35
> You will say, “They have struck me, but I am not harmed!
> “They beat me, but I did not know it!
> “When will I awake? I will look for another drink.”
