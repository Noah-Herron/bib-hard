# Isaiah 55
## The Lord Gives an Invitation
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Hey, all who are thirsty, come to the water!
>  “ You who have no money, come!
>  “ Buy and eat!
>  “ Come! Buy wine and milk
>  “ Without money and without cost.
###### 2
>  “ Why pay money for something that will not nourish you?
>  “ Why spend your hard-earned money on something that will not satisfy?
>  “ Listen carefully to me and eat what is nourishing!
>  “ Enjoy fine food.
###### 3
>  “ Pay attention and come to me.
>  “ Listen, so you can live.
>  “ Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you,
>  “ Just like the reliable covenantal promises I made to David.
###### 4
>  “ Look, I made him a witness to nations,
>  “ A ruler and commander of nations.”
###### 5
> Look, you will summon nations you did not previously know;
> Nations that did not previously know you will run to you,
> Because of the LORD your God,
> The Holy One of Israel,
> For he bestows honor on you.
###### ¶ 6
> Seek the LORD while he makes himself available;
> Call to him while he is nearby!
###### 7
> The wicked need to abandon their lifestyle
> And sinful people their plans.
> They should return to the LORD, and he will show mercy to them,
> And to their God, for he will freely forgive them.
###### 8
>  “ Indeed, my plans are not like your plans,
>  “ And my deeds are not like your deeds,” says the LORD,
###### 9
>  “ For just as the sky is higher than the earth,
>  “ So my deeds are superior to your deeds
>  “ And my plans superior to your plans.
###### 10
>  “ The rain and snow fall from the sky
>  “ And do not return,
>  “ But instead water the earth
>  “ And make it produce and yield crops,
>  “ And provide seed for the planter and food for those who must eat.
###### 11
>  “ In the same way, the promise that I make
>  “ Does not return to me, having accomplished nothing.
>  “ No, it is realized as I desire
>  “ And is fulfilled as I intend.”
###### 12
> Indeed you will go out with joy;
> You will be led along in peace;
> The mountains and hills will give a joyful shout before you,
> And all the trees in the field will clap their hands.
###### 13
> Evergreens will grow in place of thorn bushes,
> Firs will grow in place of nettles;
> They will be a monument to the LORD,
> A permanent reminder that will remain.
