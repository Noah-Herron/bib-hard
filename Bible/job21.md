###### ¶ 1
Then Job answered:
###### 2
>  “ Listen carefully to my words;
>  “ Let this be the consolation you offer me.
###### 3
>  “ Bear with me and I will speak,
>  “ And after I have spoken you may mock.
###### 4
>  “ Is my complaint against a man?
>  “ If so, why should I not be impatient?
###### 5
>  “ Look at me and be appalled;
>  “ Put your hands over your mouths.
###### 6
>  “ For, when I think about this, I am terrified
>  “ And my body feels a shudder.”
## The Wicked Prosper
###### 7
>  “ Why do the wicked go on living,
>  “ Grow old, even increase in power?
###### 8
>  “ Their children are firmly established in their presence,
>  “ Their offspring before their eyes.
###### 9
>  “ Their houses are safe and without fear;
>  “ And no rod of punishment from God is upon them.
###### 10
>  “ Their bulls breed without fail;
>  “ Their cows calve and do not miscarry.
###### 11
>  “ They allow their children to run like a flock;
>  “ Their little ones dance about.
###### 12
>  “ They sing to the accompaniment of tambourine and harp,
>  “ And make merry to the sound of the flute.
###### 13
>  “ They live out their years in prosperity
>  “ And go down to the grave in peace.
###### 14
>  “ So they say to God, ‘Turn away from us!
>  ‘ We do not want to know your ways.
###### 15
>  ‘ Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
>  ‘ What would we gain
>  ‘ If we were to pray to him?’

## How Often Do the Wicked Suffer?
###### ¶ 17
>  “ How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished?
>  “ How often does their misfortune come upon them?
>  “ How often does God apportion pain to them in his anger?
###### 18
>  “ How often are they like straw before the wind,
>  “ And like chaff swept away by a whirlwind?
###### 19
>  “ You may say, ‘God stores up a man’s punishment for his children!’
>  “ Instead let him repay the man himself
>  “ So that he may be humbled!
###### 20
>  “ Let his own eyes see his destruction;
>  “ Let him drink of the anger of the Almighty.
###### 21
>  “ For what is his interest in his home
>  “ After his death,
>  “ When the number of his months
>  “ Has been broken off?
###### 22

>  “ Since he judges those that are on high?”
## Death Levels Everything
###### 23
>  “ One man dies in his full vigor,
>  “ Completely secure and prosperous,
###### 24
>  “ His body well nourished,
>  “ And the marrow of his bones moist.
###### 25
>  “ And another man dies in bitterness of soul,
>  “ Never having tasted anything good.
###### 26
>  “ Together they lie down in the dust,
>  “ And worms cover over them both.”
## Futile Words, Deceptive Answers
###### ¶ 27
>  “ Yes, I know what you are thinking,
>  “ The schemes by which you would wrong me.
###### 28
>  “ For you say,
>  ‘ Where now is the nobleman’s house,
>  ‘ And where are the tents in which the wicked lived?’
###### 29
>  “ Have you never questioned those who travel the roads?
>  “ Do you not recognize their accounts—
###### 30
>  “ That the evil man is spared
>  “ From the day of his misfortune,
>  “ That he is delivered
>  “ From the day of God’s wrath?
###### 31
>  “ No one denounces his conduct to his face;
>  “ No one repays him for what he has done.
###### 32
>  “ And when he is carried to the tombs,
>  “ And watch is kept over the funeral mound,
###### 33
>  “ The clods of the torrent valley are sweet to him;
>  “ Behind him everybody follows in procession,
>  “ And before him goes a countless throng.
###### 34
>  “ So how can you console me with your futile words?
>  “ Nothing is left of your answers but deception!”
