# Psalm 91
###### ¶ 1
> As for you, the one who lives in the shelter of the Most High,
> And resides in the protective shadow of the Sovereign One—
###### 2
> I say this about the LORD, my shelter and my stronghold,
> My God in whom I trust—
###### 3
> He will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter
> And from the destructive plague.
###### 4
> He will shelter you with his wings;
> You will find safety under his wings.
> His faithfulness is like a shield or a protective wall.
###### ¶ 5
> You need not fear the terrors of the night,
> The arrow that flies by day,
###### 6
> The plague that stalks in the darkness,
> Or the disease that ravages at noon.
###### 7
> Though a thousand may fall beside you,
> And a multitude on your right side,
> It will not reach you.
###### 8
> Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes—
> You will see the wicked paid back.
###### 9
> For you have taken refuge in the LORD,
> My shelter, the Most High.
###### 10
> No harm will overtake you;
> No illness will come near your home.
###### ¶ 11
> For he will order his angels
> To protect you in all you do.
###### 12
> They will lift you up in their hands,
> So you will not slip and fall on a stone.
###### 13
> You will subdue a lion and a snake;
> You will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent.
###### ¶ 14
> The LORD says,
> “Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him;
> “I will protect him because he is loyal to me.
###### 15
> “When he calls out to me, I will answer him.
> “I will be with him when he is in trouble;
> “I will rescue him and bring him honor.
###### 16
> “I will satisfy him with long life,
> “And will let him see my salvation.”
