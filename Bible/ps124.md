# Psalm 124
###### ¶ 1
> “If the LORD had not been on our side”—
> Let Israel say this.—
###### 2
> If the LORD had not been on our side,
> When men attacked us,
###### 3
> They would have swallowed us alive,
> When their anger raged against us.
###### 4
> The water would have overpowered us;
> The current would have overwhelmed us.
###### 5
> The raging water
> Would have overwhelmed us.
###### ¶ 6
> The LORD deserves praise,
> For he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth.
###### 7
> We escaped with our lives, like a bird from a hunter’s snare.
> The snare broke, and we escaped.
###### 8
> Our deliverer is the LORD,
> The Creator of heaven and earth.
