## More Visions and Messages of Judgment
###### ¶ 1
The Sovereign LORD showed me this: I saw a basket of summer fruit.

> And do away with the destitute in the land.
###### 5
You say,
>  “ When will the new moon festival be over, so we can sell grain?

>  “ And to cheat the buyer with rigged scales!

>  “ And make the earth dark in the middle of the day.
###### 10
> I will turn your festivals into funerals
> And all your songs into funeral dirges.

###### ¶ 11

>  “ But they will not find any.
