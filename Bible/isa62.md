# Isaiah 62
## The Lord Takes Delight in Zion
###### ¶ 1
> For the sake of Zion I will not be silent;
> For the sake of Jerusalem I will not be quiet,
> Until her vindication shines brightly
> And her deliverance burns like a torch.
###### 2
> Nations will see your vindication,
> And all kings your splendor.
> You will be called by a new name
> That the LORD himself will give you.
###### 3
> You will be a majestic crown in the hand of the LORD,
> A royal turban in the hand of your God.
###### 4
> You will no longer be called, “Abandoned,”
> And your land will no longer be called “Desolate.”
> Indeed, you will be called “My Delight is in Her,”
> And your land “Married.”
> For the LORD will take delight in you,
> And your land will be married to him.
###### 5
> As a young man marries a young woman,
> So your sons will marry you.
> As a bridegroom rejoices over a bride,
> So your God will rejoice over you.
###### ¶ 6

> They should keep praying all day and all night.
> You who pray to the LORD, don’t be silent!
