# Psalm 43
###### ¶ 1
> Vindicate me, O God!
> Fight for me against an ungodly nation.
> Deliver me from deceitful and evil men.
###### 2
> For you are the God who shelters me.
> Why do you reject me?
> Why must I walk around mourning
> Because my enemies oppress me?
###### ¶ 3
> Reveal your light and your faithfulness.
> They will lead me;
> They will escort me back to your holy hill,
> And to the place where you live.
###### 4
> Then I will go to the altar of God,
> To the God who gives me ecstatic joy,
> So that I may express my thanks to you, O God, my God, with a harp.
###### ¶ 5
> Why are you depressed, O my soul?
> Why are you upset?
> Wait for God!
> For I will again give thanks
> To my God for his saving intervention.
