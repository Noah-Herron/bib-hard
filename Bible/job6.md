# Job 6
## Job Replies to Eliphaz
###### ¶ 1
Then Job responded:
###### 2
>  “ Oh, if only my grief could be weighed,
>  “ And my misfortune laid on the scales too!
###### 3
>  “ But because it is heavier than the sand of the sea,
>  “ That is why my words have been wild.
###### 4
>  “ For the arrows of the Almighty are within me;
>  “ My spirit drinks their poison;
>  “ God’s sudden terrors are arrayed against me.”
## Complaints Reflect Suffering
###### 5
>  “ Does the wild donkey bray when it is near grass?
>  “ Or does the ox bellow over its fodder?
###### 6
>  “ Can food that is tasteless be eaten without salt?
>  “ Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
###### 7
>  “ I have refused to touch such things;
>  “ They are like loathsome food to me.”
## A Cry for Death
###### ¶ 8
>  “ Oh that my request would be realized,
>  “ And that God would grant me what I long for!
###### 9
>  “ And that God would be willing to crush me,
>  “ That he would let loose his hand
>  “ And kill me.
###### 10
>  “ Then I would yet have my comfort,
>  “ Then I would rejoice,
>  “ In spite of pitiless pain,
>  “ For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
###### 11
>  “ What is my strength, that I should wait?
>  “ And what is my end,
>  “ That I should prolong my life?
###### 12
>  “ Is my strength like that of stones?
>  “ Or is my flesh made of bronze?
###### 13
>  “ Is not my power to help myself nothing,
>  “ And has not every resource been driven from me?”
## Disappointing Friends
###### ¶ 14
>  “ To the one in despair, kindness should come from his friend
>  “ Even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
###### 15
>  “ My brothers have been as treacherous as a seasonal stream,
>  “ And as the riverbeds of the intermittent streams
>  “ That flow away.
###### 16
>  “ They are dark because of ice;
>  “ Snow is piled up over them.
###### 17
>  “ When they are scorched, they dry up,
>  “ When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
###### 18
>  “ Caravans turn aside from their routes;
>  “ They go into the wasteland and perish.
###### 19
>  “ The caravans of Tema looked intently for these streams;
>  “ The traveling merchants of Sheba hoped for them.
###### 20
>  “ They were distressed,
>  “ Because each one had been so confident;
>  “ They arrived there, but were disappointed.
###### 21
>  “ For now you have become like these streams that are no help;
>  “ You see a terror, and are afraid.”
## Friends’ Fears
###### 22
>  “ Have I ever said, ‘Give me something,
>  ‘ And from your fortune make gifts in my favor’?
###### 23
>  “ Or, ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s power,
>  ‘ And from the hand of tyrants ransom me’?
## No Sin Discovered
###### ¶ 24
>  “ Teach me and I, for my part, will be silent;
>  “ Explain to me how I have been mistaken.
###### 25
>  “ How painful are honest words!
>  “ But what does your reproof prove?
###### 26
>  “ Do you intend to criticize mere words,
>  “ And treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
###### 27
>  “ Yes, you would gamble for the fatherless,
>  “ And auction off your friend.”
## Other Explanation
###### 28
>  “ Now then, be good enough to look at me;
>  “ And I will not lie to your face!
###### 29
>  “ Relent, let there be no falsehood;
>  “ Reconsider, for my righteousness is intact!
###### 30
>  “ Is there any falsehood on my lips?
>  “ Can my mouth not discern evil things?
