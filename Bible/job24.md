# Job 24
## The Apparent Indifference of God
###### ¶ 1
>  “ Why are times not appointed by the Almighty?
>  “ Why do those who know him not see his days?
###### 2
>  “ Men move boundary stones;
>  “ They seize the flock and pasture them.
###### 3
>  “ They drive away the orphan’s donkey;
>  “ They take the widow’s ox as a pledge.
###### 4
>  “ They turn the needy from the pathway,
>  “ And the poor of the land hide themselves together.
###### 5
>  “ Like wild donkeys in the wilderness,
>  “ They go out to their labor seeking diligently for food;
>  “ The arid rift valley provides food for them and for their children.
###### 6
>  “ They reap fodder in the field,
>  “ And glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
###### 7
>  “ They spend the night naked because they lack clothing;
>  “ They have no covering against the cold.
###### 8
>  “ They are soaked by mountain rains
>  “ And huddle in the rocks because they lack shelter.
###### 9
>  “ The fatherless child is snatched from the breast,
>  “ The infant of the poor is taken as a pledge.
###### 10
>  “ They go about naked, without clothing,
>  “ And go hungry while they carry the sheaves.
###### 11
>  “ They press out the olive oil between the rows of olive trees;
>  “ They tread the winepresses while they are thirsty.
###### 12
>  “ From the city the dying groan,
>  “ And the wounded cry out for help,
>  “ But God charges no one with wrongdoing.
###### ¶ 13
>  “ There are those who rebel against the light;
>  “ They do not know its ways
>  “ And they do not stay on its paths.
###### 14
>  “ Before daybreak the murderer rises up;
>  “ He kills the poor and the needy;
>  “ In the night he is like a thief.
###### 15
>  “ And the eye of the adulterer watches for the twilight,
>  “ Thinking, ‘No eye can see me,’
>  “ And covers his face with a mask.
###### 16
>  “ In the dark the robber breaks into houses,
>  “ But by day they shut themselves in;
>  “ They do not know the light.
###### 17
>  “ For all of them, the morning is to them like deep darkness;
>  “ They are friends with the terrors of darkness.
###### ¶ 18
>  “ You say, ‘He is foam on the face of the waters;
>  ‘ Their portion of the land is cursed
>  ‘ So that no one goes to their vineyard.
###### 19
>  ‘ The drought as well as the heat
>  ‘ Snatch up the melted snow;
>  ‘ So the grave snatches up the sinner.
###### 20
>  ‘ The womb forgets him,
>  ‘ The worm feasts on him,
>  ‘ No longer will he be remembered.
>  ‘ Like a tree, wickedness will be broken down.
###### 21
>  ‘ He preys on the barren and childless woman,
>  ‘ And does not treat the widow well.
###### ¶ 22
>  ‘ But God drags off the mighty by his power;
>  ‘ When God rises up against him, he has no faith in his life.
###### 23
>  ‘ God may let them rest in a feeling of security,
>  ‘ But he is constantly watching all their ways.
###### 24
>  ‘ They are exalted for a little while, and then they are gone,
>  ‘ They are brought low like all others, and gathered in,
>  ‘ And like a head of grain they are cut off.’
###### 25
>  “ If this is not so, who can prove me a liar
>  “ And reduce my words to nothing?”
