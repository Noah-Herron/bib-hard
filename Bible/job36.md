# Job 36
## Elihu’s Fourth Speech
###### ¶ 1
Elihu said further:
###### 2
>  “ Be patient with me a little longer
>  “ And I will instruct you,
>  “ For I still have words to speak on God’s behalf.
###### 3
>  “ With my knowledge I will speak comprehensively,
>  “ And to my Creator I will ascribe righteousness.
###### 4
>  “ For in truth, my words are not false;
>  “ It is one complete in knowledge
>  “ Who is with you.
###### 5
>  “ Indeed, God is mighty; and he does not despise people,
>  “ He is mighty, and firm in his intent.
###### 6
>  “ He does not allow the wicked to live,
>  “ But he gives justice to the poor.
###### 7
>  “ He does not take his eyes off the righteous;
>  “ But with kings on the throne
>  “ He seats the righteous and exalts them forever.
###### 8
>  “ But if they are bound in chains,
>  “ And held captive by the cords of affliction,
###### 9
>  “ Then he reveals to them what they have done,
>  “ And their transgressions,
>  “ That they were behaving proudly.
###### 10
>  “ And he reveals this for correction,
>  “ And says that they must turn from evil.
###### 11
>  “ If they obey and serve him,
>  “ They live out their days in prosperity
>  “ And their years in pleasantness.
###### 12
>  “ But if they refuse to listen,
>  “ They pass over the river of death,
>  “ And expire without knowledge.
###### 13
>  “ The godless at heart nourish anger,
>  “ They do not cry out even when he binds them.
###### 14
>  “ They die in their youth,
>  “ And their life ends among the male cultic prostitutes.
###### 15
>  “ He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions,
>  “ He reveals himself to them by their suffering.
###### 16
>  “ And surely, he drew you from the mouth of distress,
>  “ To a wide place, unrestricted,
>  “ And to the comfort of your table
>  “ Filled with rich food.
###### ¶ 17
>  “ But now you are preoccupied with the judgment due the wicked,
>  “ Judgment and justice take hold of you.
###### 18
>  “ Be careful that no one entices you with riches;
>  “ Do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
###### 19
>  “ Would your wealth sustain you,
>  “ So that you would not be in distress,
>  “ Even all your mighty efforts?
###### 20
>  “ Do not long for the cover of night
>  “ To drag people away from their homes.
###### 21
>  “ Take heed, do not turn to evil,
>  “ For because of this you have been tested by affliction.
###### 22
>  “ Indeed, God is exalted in his power;
>  “ Who is a teacher like him?
###### 23
>  “ Who has prescribed his ways for him?
>  “ Or said to him, ‘You have done what is wicked’?
###### ¶ 24
>  “ Remember to extol his work,
>  “ Which people have praised in song.
###### 25
>  “ All humanity has seen it;
>  “ People gaze on it from afar.”
## The Work and Wisdom of God
###### 26
>  “ Yes, God is great—beyond our knowledge!
>  “ The number of his years is unsearchable.
###### 27
>  “ He draws up drops of water;
>  “ They distill the rain into its mist,
###### 28
>  “ Which the clouds pour down
>  “ And shower on humankind abundantly.
###### 29
>  “ Who can understand the spreading of the clouds,
>  “ The thunderings of his pavilion?
###### 30
>  “ See how he scattered his lightning about him;
>  “ He has covered the depths of the sea.
###### 31
>  “ It is by these that he judges the nations
>  “ And supplies food in abundance.
###### 32
>  “ With his hands he covers the lightning,
>  “ And directs it against its target.
###### 33
>  “ His thunder announces the coming storm,
>  “ The cattle also, concerning the storm’s approach.
