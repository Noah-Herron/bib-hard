# Proverbs 7
## Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress
###### ¶ 1
> My child, devote yourself to my words
> And store up my commands inside yourself.
###### 2
> Keep my commands so that you may live,
> And obey my instruction as your most prized possession.
###### 3
> Bind them on your forearm;
> Write them on the tablet of your heart.
###### 4
> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
> And call understanding a close relative,
###### 5
> So that they may keep you from the adulterous woman,
> From the loose woman who has flattered you with her words.
###### ¶ 6
> For at the window of my house
> Through my window lattice I looked out
###### 7
> And I saw among the naive—
> I discerned among the youths—
> A young man who lacked sense.
###### 8
> He was passing by the street near her corner,
> Making his way along the road to her house
###### 9
> In the twilight, the evening,
> In the dark of the night.
###### 10
> Suddenly a woman came out to meet him!
> She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.
###### 11
> She is loud and rebellious,
> She does not remain at home—
###### 12
> At one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,
> And by every corner she lies in wait.
###### 13
> So she grabbed him and kissed him,
> And with a bold expression she said to him,
###### 14
>  “ I have meat from my peace offerings at home;
>  “ Today I have fulfilled my vows!
###### 15
>  “ That is why I came out to meet you,
>  “ To look for you, and I found you!
###### 16
>  “ I have spread my bed with elegant coverings,
>  “ With richly colored fabric from Egypt.
###### 17
>  “ I have perfumed my bed
>  “ With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
###### 18
>  “ Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning,
>  “ Let’s delight ourselves with love’s pleasures.
###### 19
>  “ For my husband is not at home;
>  “ He has gone on a journey of some distance.
###### 20
>  “ He has taken a bag of money with him;
>  “ He will not return until the end of the month.”
###### 21
> She turned him aside with her persuasions;
> With her smooth talk she was enticing him along.
###### 22
> Suddenly he was going after her
> Like an ox that goes to the slaughter,
> Like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare
###### 23
> Till an arrow pierces his liver—
> Like a bird hurrying into a trap,
> And he does not know that it will cost him his life.
###### ¶ 24
> So now, sons, listen to me,
> And pay attention to the words I speak.
###### 25
> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways—
> Do not wander into her pathways;
###### 26
> For she has brought down many fatally wounded,
> And all those she has slain are many.
###### 27
> Her house is the way to the grave,
> Going down to the chambers of death.
