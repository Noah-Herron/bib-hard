# Isaiah 30
## Egypt Will Prove Unreliable
###### ¶ 1
> “The rebellious children are as good as dead,” says the LORD,
> “Those who make plans without consulting me,
> “Who form alliances without consulting my Spirit,
> “And thereby compound their sin.
###### 2
> “They travel down to Egypt
> “Without seeking my will,
> “Seeking Pharaoh’s protection,
> “And looking for safety in Egypt’s protective shade.
###### 3
> “But Pharaoh’s protection will bring you nothing but shame,
> “And the safety of Egypt’s protective shade nothing but humiliation.
###### 4
> “Though his officials are in Zoan
> “And his messengers arrive at Hanes,
###### 5
> “All will be put to shame
> “Because of a nation that cannot help them,
> “Who cannot give them aid or help,
> “But only shame and disgrace.”
###### ¶ 6
> This is an oracle about the animals in the Negev:
> Through a land of distress and danger,
> Inhabited by lionesses and roaring lions,
> By snakes and darting adders,
> They transport their wealth on the backs of donkeys,
> Their riches on the humps of camels,
> To a nation that cannot help them.
###### 7
> Egypt is totally incapable of helping.
> For this reason I call her
> “Proud one who is silenced.”
###### 8
> Now go, write it down on a tablet in their presence,
> Inscribe it on a scroll,
> So that it might be preserved for a future time
> As an enduring witness.
###### 9
> For these are rebellious people—
> They are lying children,
> Children unwilling to obey the LORD’s law.
###### 10
> They say to the visionaries, “See no more visions!”
> And to the seers, “Don’t relate messages to us about what is right!
> “Tell us nice things;
> “Relate deceptive messages.
###### 11
> “Turn aside from the way;
> “Stray off the path.
> “Remove from our presence the Holy One of Israel.”
###### 12
> For this reason this is what the Holy One of Israel says:
> “You have rejected this message;
> “You trust instead in your ability to oppress and trick,
> “And rely on that kind of behavior.
###### 13
> “So this sin will become your downfall.
> “You will be like a high wall
> “That bulges and cracks and is ready to collapse;
> “It crumbles suddenly, in a flash.
###### 14
> “It shatters in pieces like a clay jar,
> “So shattered to bits that none of it can be salvaged.
> “Among its fragments one cannot find a shard large enough
> “To scoop a hot coal from a fire
> “Or to skim off water from a cistern.”
###### 15
For this is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel says:
> “If you repented and patiently waited for me, you would be delivered;
> “If you calmly trusted in me, you would find strength,
> “But you are unwilling.
###### 16
> “You say, ‘No, we will flee on horses,’
> “So you will indeed flee.
> “You say, ‘We will ride on fast horses,’
> “So your pursuers will be fast.
###### 17
> “One thousand will scurry at the battle cry of one enemy soldier;
> “At the battle cry of five enemy soldiers you will all run away,
> “Until the remaining few are as isolated
> “As a flagpole on a mountaintop
> “Or a signal flag on a hill.”
## The Lord Will Not Abandon His People
###### ¶ 18
> For this reason the LORD is ready to show you mercy;
> He sits on his throne, ready to have compassion on you.
> Indeed, the LORD is a just God;
> All who wait for him in faith will be blessed.
###### ¶ 19
> For people will live in Zion;
> In Jerusalem you will weep no more.
> When he hears your cry of despair, he will indeed show you mercy;
> When he hears it, he will respond to you.
###### 20
> The Lord will give you distress to eat
> And suffering to drink;
> But your teachers will no longer be hidden;
> Your eyes will see them.
###### 21
> You will hear a word spoken behind you, saying,
> “This is the correct way, walk in it,”
> Whether you are heading to the right or the left.
###### 22
> You will desecrate your silver-plated idols
> And your gold-plated images.
> You will throw them away as if they were a menstrual rag,
> Saying to them, “Get out!”
###### ¶ 23
> He will water the seed you plant in the ground,
> And the ground will produce crops in abundance.
> At that time your cattle will graze in wide pastures.
###### 24
> The oxen and donkeys used in plowing
> Will eat seasoned feed winnowed with a shovel and pitchfork.
###### 25
> On every high mountain
> And every high hill
> There will be streams flowing with water,
> At the time of great slaughter when the fortified towers collapse.
###### 26
> The light of the full moon will be like the sun’s glare,
> And the sun’s glare will be seven times brighter,
> Like the light of seven days,
> When the LORD binds up his people’s fractured bones
> And heals their severe wound.
###### ¶ 27
> Look, the name of the LORD comes from a distant place
> In raging anger and awesome splendor.
> He speaks angrily,
> And his word is like destructive fire.
###### 28
> His battle cry overwhelms like a flooding river
> That reaches one’s neck.
> He shakes the nations in a sieve that isolates the chaff;
> He puts a bit into the mouth of the nations and leads them to destruction.
###### 29
> You will sing
> As you do in the evening when you are celebrating a festival.
> You will be happy like one who plays a flute
> As he goes to the mountain of the LORD, the Rock who shelters Israel.
###### 30
> The LORD will give a mighty shout
> And intervene in power,
> With furious anger and flaming, destructive fire,
> With a driving rainstorm and hailstones.
###### 31
> Indeed, the LORD’s shout will shatter Assyria;
> He will beat them with a club.
###### 32
> Every blow from his punishing cudgel
> With which the LORD will beat them
> Will be accompanied by music from the tambourine and harp,
> And he will attack them with his weapons.
###### 33
> For the burial place is already prepared;
> It has been made deep and wide for the king.
> The firewood is piled high on it.
> The LORD’s breath, like a stream flowing with brimstone,
> Will ignite it.
