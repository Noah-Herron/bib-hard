# Job 22
## Eliphaz’s Third Speech
###### ¶ 1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
###### 2
>  “ Is it to God that a strong man is of benefit?
>  “ Is it to him that even a wise man is profitable?
###### 3
>  “ Is it of any special benefit to the Almighty
>  “ That you should be righteous,
>  “ Or is it any gain to him
>  “ That you make your ways blameless?
###### 4
>  “ Is it because of your piety that he rebukes you
>  “ And goes to judgment with you?
###### 5
>  “ Is not your wickedness great
>  “ And is there no end to your iniquity?
###### 6
>  “ For you took pledges from your brothers
>  “ For no reason,
>  “ And you stripped the clothing from the naked.
###### 7
>  “ You gave the weary no water to drink
>  “ And from the hungry you withheld food.
###### 8
>  “ Although you were a powerful man, owning land,
>  “ An honored man living on it,
###### 9
>  “ You sent widows away empty-handed,
>  “ And the arms of the orphans you crushed.
###### 10
>  “ That is why snares surround you,
>  “ And why sudden fear terrifies you,
###### 11
>  “ Why it is so dark you cannot see,
>  “ And why a flood of water covers you.
###### ¶ 12
>  “ Is not God on high in heaven?
>  “ And see the lofty stars, how high they are!
###### 13
>  “ But you have said, ‘What does God know?
>  ‘ Does he judge through such deep darkness?
###### 14
>  ‘ Thick clouds are a veil for him, so he does not see us,
>  ‘ As he goes back and forth
>  ‘ In the vault of heaven.’
###### 15
>  “ Will you keep to the old path
>  “ That evil men have walked—
###### 16
>  “ Men who were carried off before their time,
>  “ When the flood was poured out
>  “ On their foundations?
###### 17
>  “ They were saying to God, ‘Turn away from us,’
>  “ And, ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’
###### 18
>  “ But it was he who filled their houses
>  “ With good things—
>  “ Yet the counsel of the wicked
>  “ Was far from me.
###### 19
>  “ The righteous see their destruction and rejoice;
>  “ The innocent mock them scornfully, saying,
###### 20
>  ‘ Surely our enemies are destroyed,
>  ‘ And fire consumes their wealth.’
###### ¶ 21
>  “ Reconcile yourself with God,
>  “ And be at peace with him;
>  “ In this way your prosperity will be good.
###### 22
>  “ Accept instruction from his mouth
>  “ And store up his words in your heart.
###### 23
>  “ If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up;
>  “ If you remove wicked behavior far from your tent,
###### 24
>  “ And throw your gold in the dust—
>  “ Your gold of Ophir
>  “ Among the rocks in the ravines—
###### 25
>  “ Then the Almighty himself will be your gold,
>  “ And the choicest silver for you.
###### 26
>  “ Surely then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,
>  “ And will lift up your face toward God.
###### 27
>  “ You will pray to him and he will hear you,
>  “ And you will fulfill your vows to him.
###### 28
>  “ Whatever you decide on a matter,
>  “ It will be established for you,
>  “ And light will shine on your ways.
###### 29
>  “ When people are brought low and you say,
>  ‘ Lift them up!’
>  “ Then he will save the downcast;
###### 30
>  “ He will deliver even someone who is not innocent,
>  “ Who will escape through the cleanness of your hands.”
