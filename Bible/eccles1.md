## Futility Illustrated from Nature
###### ¶ 3
> What benefit do people get from all the effort
> Which they expend on earth?
###### 4
> A generation comes and a generation goes,
> But the earth remains the same through the ages.
###### 5
> The sun rises and the sun sets;
> It hurries away to a place from which it rises again.
###### 6
> The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north;
> Round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.
###### 7
> All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full,
> And to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.
###### 8
> All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it.
> The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.
###### 9
> What exists now is what will be,
> And what has been done is what will be done;
> There is nothing truly new on earth.
###### 10
> Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new”?
> It was already done long ago, before our time.
###### 11
> No one remembers the former events,
> Nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen;
> They will not be remembered by the future generations.
## Futility of Secular Accomplishment
###### ¶ 12
> I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
###### 13
> I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine
> All that has been accomplished on earth.
> I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task
> That keeps them occupied.
###### 14
> I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth,
> And I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile—like chasing the wind!
###### 15
> What is bent cannot be straightened,
> And what is missing cannot be supplied.
## Futility of Secular Wisdom
###### ¶ 16
> I thought to myself,
>  “ I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem;
>  “ I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”
###### 17
> So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas;
> However, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind.
###### 18
> For with great wisdom comes great frustration;
> Whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache.
