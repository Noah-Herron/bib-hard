# Psalm 141
###### ¶ 1
> O LORD, I cry out to you. Come quickly to me.
> Pay attention to me when I cry out to you.
###### 2
> May you accept my prayer like incense,
> My uplifted hands like the evening offering.
###### 3
> O LORD, place a guard on my mouth.
> Protect the opening of my lips.
###### 4
> Do not let me have evil desires,
> Or participate in sinful activities
> With men who behave wickedly.
> I will not eat their delicacies.
###### ¶ 5
> May the godly strike me in love and correct me.
> May my head not refuse choice oil.
> Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds.
###### 6
> They will be thrown over the side of a cliff by their judges.
> They will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.
###### 7
> As when one plows and breaks up the soil,
> So our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
###### ¶ 8
> Surely I am looking to you, O Sovereign LORD.
> In you I take shelter.
> Do not expose me to danger.
###### 9
> Protect me from the snare they have laid for me,
> And the traps the evildoers have set.
###### 10
> Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
> While I escape.
