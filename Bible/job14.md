# Job 14
## The Brevity of Life
###### ¶ 1
> “Man, born of woman,
> “Lives but a few days, and they are full of trouble.
###### 2
> “He grows up like a flower and then withers away;
> “He flees like a shadow, and does not remain.
###### 3
> “Do you fix your eye on such a one?
> “And do you bring me before you for judgment?
###### 4
> “Who can make a clean thing come from an unclean?
> “No one!
###### 5
> “Since man’s days are determined,
> “The number of his months is under your control;
> “You have set his limit and he cannot pass it.
###### 6
> “Look away from him and let him desist,
> “Until he fulfills his time like a hired man.”
## The Inevitability of Death
###### ¶ 7
> “But there is hope for a tree:
> “If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
> “And its new shoots will not fail.
###### 8
> “Although its roots may grow old in the ground
> “And its stump begins to die in the soil,
###### 9
> “At the scent of water it will flourish
> “And put forth shoots like a new plant.
###### 10
> “But man dies and is powerless;
> “He expires—and where is he?
###### 11
> “As water disappears from the sea,
> “Or a river drains away and dries up,
###### 12
> “So man lies down and does not rise;
> “Until the heavens are no more,
> “They will not awake
> “Nor arise from their sleep.”
## The Possibility of Another Life
###### ¶ 13
> “O that you would hide me in Sheol,
> “And conceal me till your anger has passed!
> “O that you would set me a time
> “And then remember me!
###### 14
> “If a man dies, will he live again?
> “All the days of my hard service I will wait
> “Until my release comes.
###### 15
> “You will call and I—I will answer you;
> “You will long for the creature you have made.”
## The Present Condition
###### 16
> “Surely now you count my steps;
> “Then you would not mark my sin.
###### 17
> “My offenses would be sealed up in a bag;
> “You would cover over my sin.
###### ¶ 18
> “But as a mountain falls away and crumbles,
> “And as a rock will be removed from its place,
###### 19
> “As water wears away stones,
> “And torrents wash away the soil,
> “So you destroy man’s hope.
###### 20
> “You overpower him once for all,
> “And he departs;
> “You change his appearance
> “And send him away.
###### 21
> “If his sons are honored,
> “He does not know it;
> “If they are brought low,
> “He does not see it.
###### 22
> “His flesh only has pain for him,
> “And he mourns for himself.”
