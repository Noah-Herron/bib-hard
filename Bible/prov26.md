# Proverbs 26
###### ¶ 1

> So honor is not fitting for a fool.
###### 2
> Like a fluttering bird or like a flying swallow,
> So a curse without cause does not come to rest.
###### 3
> A whip for the horse and a bridle for the donkey,
> And a rod for the backs of fools!
###### 4
> Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
> Lest you yourself also be like him.
###### 5
> Answer a fool according to his folly,
> Lest he be wise in his own opinion.
###### 6
> Like cutting off the feet or drinking violence,
> So is sending a message by the hand of a fool.
###### 7
> Like legs dangle uselessly from the lame,
> So a proverb dangles in the mouth of fools.
###### 8
> Like tying a stone in a sling,
> So is giving honor to a fool.
###### 9
> Like a thorn has gone up into the hand of a drunkard,
> So a proverb has gone up into the mouth of a fool.
###### 10
> Like an archer who wounds at random,
> So is the one who hires a fool or hires any passerby.
###### 11

> So a fool repeats his folly.
###### 12
> You have seen a man wise in his own opinion—

###### 13
> The sluggard has said, “There is a lion in the road!
>  “ A lion in the streets!”
###### 14
> Like a door that turns on its hinges,
> So a sluggard turns on his bed.
###### 15

> He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
###### 16
> The sluggard is wiser in his own opinion
> Than seven people who respond with good sense.
###### 17
> Like one who grabs a wild dog by the ears,
> So is the person passing by who becomes furious over a quarrel not his own.
###### 18
> Like a madman who shoots
> Firebrands and deadly arrows,
###### 19
> So is a person who has deceived his neighbor,
> And said, “Was I not only joking?”
###### 20
> Where there is no wood, a fire goes out,
> And where there is no gossip, contention ceases.
###### 21
> Like charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,
> So is a contentious person to kindle strife.
###### 22
> The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;
> And they have gone down into a person’s innermost being.
###### 23
> Like a coating of glaze over earthenware
> Are fervent lips with an evil heart.
###### 24
> The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,
> But he stores up deceit within him.
###### 25
> When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,
> For there are seven abominations within him.
###### 26
> Though his hatred may be concealed by deceit,
> His evil will be uncovered in the assembly.
###### 27
> The one who digs a pit will fall into it;
> The one who rolls a stone—it will come back on him.
###### 28
> A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,
> And a flattering mouth works ruin.
