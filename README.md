# bib (a CLI Bible reference tool)

bib is a CLI program that quickly prints Bible verses to the Terminal, using markdown files for the Bible generated by my [BibleGateway-to-Obsidian script](https://github.com/prestonharberts/biblegateway-to-obsidian).

Soon I will include the NET translation as its copyright allows for redistribution.

## Usage

I recommend putting this script in your PATH so that it can be called from anywhere. I made a Bin folder in my user directory, moved bib to it, and added this line to my `.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH=/home/$USER/Bin/:$PATH
```

Next, give execution privileges to bib:

```bash
chmod u+x ~/Bin/bib
```

Until I get the NET translation working so I can show example output, here are some example usecases. By default, the previous and next 2 verses are also printed to show context. The specific verse you request is printed in red to stand out from the context verses.

```bash
# this prints the entire Genesis 1 chapter
bib gen1

# this prints just Genesis 1:1 (and context verses Genesis 1:2-3)
bib gen1 1

# this prints the verses Genesis 1:1-2 (no context verses are printed)
bib gen1 1 2

# this prints John 3:16 (without any context verses)
bib -c john3 16
```

Support to automatically copy the output to the clipboard isn't fully supported, but it would be done like this if you can remove the color codes that get introduced with my code. Just make sure to install `xclip`.

```bash
bib john3 16|xclip -sel clipboard
```

## Example (NKJV)

Here is an example of the program running with the [New King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-King-James-Version-NKJV-Bible/):
