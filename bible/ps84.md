# Psalm 84
###### ¶ 1
> How lovely is the place where you live,
> O LORD of Heaven’s Armies!
###### 2
> I desperately want to be
> In the courts of the LORD’s temple.
> My heart and my entire being shout for joy
> To the living God.
###### 3
> Even the birds find a home there,
> And the swallow builds a nest,
> Where she can protect her young
> Near your altars, O LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> My King and my God.
###### 4
> How blessed are those who live in your temple
> And praise you continually. (Selah)
###### ¶ 5
> How blessed are those who find their strength in you,
> And long to travel the roads that lead to your temple.
###### 6
> As they pass through the Baca Valley,
> He provides a spring for them.
> The rain even covers it with pools of water.
###### 7
> They are sustained as they travel along;
> Each one appears before God in Zion.
###### ¶ 8
> O LORD God of Heaven’s Armies,
> Hear my prayer.
> Listen, O God of Jacob. (Selah)
###### 9
> O God, take notice of our shield.
> Show concern for your chosen king.
###### 10
> Certainly spending just one day in your temple courts is better
> Than spending a thousand elsewhere.
> I would rather stand at the entrance to the temple of my God
> Than live in the tents of the wicked.
###### 11
> For the LORD God is our sovereign protector.
> The LORD bestows favor and honor;
> He withholds no good thing from those who have integrity.
###### 12
> O LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> How blessed are those who trust in you.
