# Psalm 5
###### ¶ 1
> Listen to what I say, LORD!
> Carefully consider my complaint!
###### 2
> Pay attention to my cry for help,
> My King and my God,
> For I am praying to you!
###### 3
> LORD, in the morning you will hear me;
> In the morning I will present my case to you and then wait expectantly for an answer.
###### ¶ 4
> Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil;
> Evil people cannot dwell with you.
###### 5
> Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence;
> You hate all who behave wickedly.
###### 6
> You destroy liars;
> The LORD despises violent and deceitful people.
###### 7
> But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house;
> I will bow down toward your holy temple as I worship you.
###### ¶ 8
> LORD, lead me in your righteousness
> Because of those who wait to ambush me,
> Remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me.
###### 9
> For they do not speak the truth;
> Their stomachs are like the place of destruction,
> Their throats like an open grave,
> Their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.
###### 10
> Condemn them, O God!
> May their own schemes be their downfall.
> Drive them away because of their many acts of insurrection,
> For they have rebelled against you.
###### ¶ 11
> But may all who take shelter in you be happy.
> May they continually shout for joy.
> Shelter them so that those who are loyal to you may rejoice.
###### 12
> Certainly you reward the godly, LORD.
> Like a shield you protect them in your good favor.
