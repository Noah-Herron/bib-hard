# Isaiah 35
## The Land and Its People Are Transformed
###### ¶ 1
> Let the wilderness and desert be happy;
> Let the arid rift valley rejoice and bloom like a lily!
###### 2
> Let it richly bloom;
> Let it rejoice and shout with delight!
> It is given the grandeur of Lebanon,
> The splendor of Carmel and Sharon.
> They will see the grandeur of the LORD,
> The splendor of our God.
###### 3
> Strengthen the hands that have gone limp,
> Steady the knees that shake.
###### 4
> Tell those who panic,
> “Be strong! Do not fear!
> “Look, your God comes to avenge;
> “With divine retribution he comes to deliver you.”
###### 5
> Then blind eyes will open,
> Deaf ears will hear.
###### 6
> Then the lame will leap like a deer,
> The mute tongue will shout for joy;
> For water will burst forth in the wilderness,
> Streams in the arid rift valley.
###### 7
> The dry soil will become a pool of water,
> The parched ground springs of water.
> Where jackals once lived and sprawled out,
> Grass, reeds, and papyrus will grow.
###### 8
> A thoroughfare will be there—
> It will be called the Way of Holiness.
> The unclean will not travel on it;
> It is reserved for those authorized to use it—
> Fools will not stray into it.
###### 9
> No lions will be there,
> No ferocious wild animals will be on it—
> They will not be found there.
> Those delivered from bondage will travel on it,
###### 10
> Those whom the LORD has ransomed will return that way.
> They will enter Zion with a happy shout.
> Unending joy will crown them,
> Happiness and joy will overwhelm them;
> Grief and suffering will disappear.
