# Micah 6
## The Lord Demands Justice, not Ritual
###### ¶ 1
Listen to what the LORD says:
> “Get up! Defend yourself before the mountains.
> “Present your case before the hills.”
###### 2
> Hear the LORD’s accusation, you mountains,
> You enduring foundations of the earth.
> For the LORD has a case against his people;
> He has a dispute with Israel!
###### 3
> “My people, how have I wronged you?
> “How have I wearied you? Answer me!
###### 4
> “In fact, I brought you up from the land of Egypt;
> “I delivered you from that place of slavery.
> “I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
###### 5
> “My people, recall how King Balak of Moab planned to harm you,
> “How Balaam son of Beor responded to him.
> “Recall how you journeyed from Shittim to Gilgal,
> “So you might acknowledge that the LORD has treated you fairly.”
###### ¶ 6
> With what should I enter the LORD’s presence?
> With what should I bow before the sovereign God?
> Should I enter his presence with burnt offerings,
> With year-old calves?
###### 7
> Will the LORD accept a thousand rams
> Or ten thousand streams of olive oil?
> Should I give him my firstborn child as payment for my rebellion,
> My offspring—my own flesh and blood—for my sin?
###### 8
> He has told you, O man, what is good,
> And what the LORD really wants from you:
> He wants you to carry out justice, to love faithfulness,
> And to live obediently before your God.
###### ¶ 9
> Listen! The LORD is calling to the city!
> It is wise to respect your authority, O LORD.
> Listen, O nation, and those assembled in the city!
###### 10
> “I will not overlook, O sinful house, the dishonest gain you have hoarded away
> “Or the smaller-than-standard measure I hate so much.
###### 11
> “I do not condone the use of rigged scales,
> “Or a bag of deceptive weights.
###### 12
> “The city’s wealthy people readily resort to violence;
> “Her inhabitants tell lies;
> “Their tongues speak deceptive words.
###### 13
> “I will strike you brutally
> “And destroy you because of your sin.
###### 14
> “You will eat, but not be satisfied.
> “Even if you have the strength to overtake some prey,
> “You will not be able to carry it away;
> “If you do happen to carry away something,
> “I will deliver it over to the sword.
###### 15
> “You will plant crops, but will not harvest them;
> “You will squeeze oil from the olives, but you will have no oil to rub on your bodies;
> “You will squeeze juice from the grapes, but you will have no wine to drink.
###### 16
> “You follow Omri’s edicts
> “And all the practices of Ahab’s dynasty;
> “You follow their policies.
> “Therefore I will make you an appalling sight;
> “The city’s inhabitants will be taunted derisively,
> “And nations will mock all of you.”
