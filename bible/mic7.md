# Micah 7
## Micah Laments Judah’s Sin
###### ¶ 1
> Woe is me!
> For I am like those gathering fruit
> And those harvesting grapes,
> When there is no grape cluster to eat
> And no fresh figs that my stomach craves.
###### 2
> Faithful men have disappeared from the land;
> There are no godly men left.
> They all wait in ambush to shed blood;
> They hunt their own brother with a net.
###### 3
> They are experts at doing evil;
> Government officials and judges take bribes,
> Prominent men announce what they wish,
> And then they plan it out.
###### 4
> The best of them is like a thorn;
> Their godly are like a thorn bush.
> Woe to your watchmen;
> Your appointed punishment is on the way.
> The time of their confusion is now.
###### 5
> Do not rely on a friend;
> Do not trust a companion!
> Even with the one who lies in your arms,
> Do not share secrets!
###### 6
> For a son thinks his father is a fool,
> A daughter challenges her mother,
> And a daughter-in-law her mother-in-law;
> A man’s enemies are his own family.
###### ¶ 7
> But I will keep watching for the LORD;
> I will wait for the God who delivers me.
> My God will listen to me.
## Jerusalem Will Be Vindicated
###### 8
> My enemies, do not gloat over me!
> Though I have fallen, I will get up.
> Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.
###### ¶ 9
> I must endure the LORD’s fury,
> For I have sinned against him.
> But then he will defend my cause
> And accomplish justice on my behalf.
> He will lead me out into the light;
> I will witness his deliverance.
###### 10
> When my enemies see this, they will be covered with shame.
> They say to me, “Where is the LORD your God?”
> I will gloat over them;
> Then they will be trampled down
> Like mud in the streets.
###### 11
> It will be a day for rebuilding your walls;
> In that day your boundary will be extended.
## A Closing Prayer
###### 12
> In that day people will come to you
> From Assyria as far as Egypt,
> From Egypt as far as the Euphrates River,
> From the seacoasts and the mountains.
###### 13
> The earth will become desolate
> Because of what its inhabitants have done.
###### ¶ 14
> Shepherd your people with your rod,
> The flock that belongs to you,
> The one that lives alone in a thicket,
> In the midst of a pastureland.
> Allow them to graze in Bashan and Gilead,
> As they did in the old days.
###### 15
> “As in the days when you departed from the land of Egypt,
> “I will show you miraculous deeds.”
###### 16
> Nations will see this and be disappointed by all their strength;
> They will put their hands over their mouths
> And act as if they were deaf.
###### 17
> They will lick the dust like a snake,
> Like serpents crawling on the ground.
> They will come trembling from their strongholds
> To the LORD our God;
> They will be terrified of you.
###### 18
> Who is a God like you?
> Who forgives sin
> And pardons the rebellion
> Of those who remain among his people?
> Who does not stay angry forever,
> But delights in showing loyal love?
###### 19
> Who will once again have mercy on us?
> Who will conquer our evil deeds?
> Who will hurl all our sins into the depths of the sea?
###### 20
> You will be loyal to Jacob
> And extend your loyal love to Abraham,
> Which you promised on oath to our ancestors in ancient times.
