# Isaiah 33
## The Lord Will Restore Zion
###### ¶ 1
> The destroyer is as good as dead,
> You who have not been destroyed!
> The deceitful one is as good as dead,
> The one whom others have not deceived!
> When you are through destroying, you will be destroyed;
> When you finish deceiving, others will deceive you!
###### 2
> LORD, be merciful to us! We wait for you.
> Give us strength each morning.
> Deliver us when distress comes.
###### 3
> The nations run away when they hear a loud noise;
> The nations scatter when you spring into action!
###### 4
> Your plunder disappears as if locusts were eating it;
> They swarm over it like locusts.
###### 5
> The LORD is exalted,
> Indeed, he lives in heaven;
> He fills Zion with justice and fairness.
###### 6
> He is your constant source of stability;
> He abundantly provides safety and great wisdom;
> He gives all this to those who fear him.
###### 7
> Look, ambassadors cry out in the streets;
> Messengers sent to make peace weep bitterly.
###### 8
> Highways are empty,
> There are no travelers.
> Treaties are broken,
> Witnesses are despised,
> Human life is treated with disrespect.
###### 9
> The land dries up and withers away;
> The forest of Lebanon shrivels up and decays.
> Sharon is like the arid rift valley;
> Bashan and Carmel are parched.
###### 10
> “Now I will rise up,” says the LORD.
> “Now I will exalt myself;
> “Now I will magnify myself.
###### 11
> “You conceive straw,
> “You give birth to chaff;
> “Your breath is a fire that destroys you.
###### 12
> “The nations will be burned to ashes;
> “Like thorn bushes that have been cut down, they will be set on fire.
###### ¶ 13
> “You who are far away, listen to what I have done!
> “You who are close by, recognize my strength.”
###### 14
> Sinners are afraid in Zion;
> Panic grips the godless.
> They say, “Who among us can coexist with destructive fire?
> “Who among us can coexist with unquenchable fire?”
###### 15
> The one who lives uprightly
> And speaks honestly;
> The one who refuses to profit from oppressive measures
> And rejects a bribe;
> The one who does not plot violent crimes
> And does not seek to harm others—
###### 16
> This is the person who will live in a secure place;
> He will find safety in the rocky, mountain strongholds;
> He will have food
> And a constant supply of water.
###### ¶ 17
> You will see a king in his splendor;
> You will see a wide land.
###### 18
> Your mind will recall the terror you experienced,
> And you will ask yourselves, “Where is the scribe?
> “Where is the one who weighs the money?
> “Where is the one who counts the towers?”
###### 19
> You will no longer see a defiant people
> Whose language you do not comprehend,
> Whose derisive speech you do not understand.
###### 20
> Look at Zion, the city where we hold religious festivals!
> You will see Jerusalem,
> A peaceful settlement,
> A tent that stays put;
> Its stakes will never be pulled up;
> None of its ropes will snap in two.
###### 21
> Instead the LORD will rule there as our mighty king.
> Rivers and wide streams will flow through it;
> No war galley will enter;
> No large ships will sail through.
###### 22
> For the LORD, our ruler,
> The LORD, our commander,
> The LORD, our king—
> He will deliver us.
###### 23
> Though at this time your ropes are slack,
> The mast is not secured,
> And the sail is not unfurled,
> At that time you will divide up a great quantity of loot;
> Even the lame will drag off plunder.
###### 24
> No resident of Zion will say, “I am ill”;
> The people who live there will have their sin forgiven.
