# Song of Songs 5
###### ¶ 1
> I have entered my garden, O my sister, my bride;
I have gathered my myrrh with my balsam spice.
I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;
I have drunk my wine and my milk!
> Eat, friends, and drink!
> Drink freely, O lovers!
## The Trials of Love: The Beloved’s Dream of Losing Her Lover
###### ¶ 2
> I was asleep, but my mind was dreaming.
Listen! My lover is knocking at the door!
> “Open for me, my sister, my darling,
“my dove, my flawless one!
“My head is drenched with dew,
“my hair with the dampness of the night.”
###### 3
> “I have already taken off my robe—must I put it on again?
> “I have already washed my feet—must I soil them again?”
###### 4
> My lover thrust his hand through the hole,
> And my feelings were stirred for him.
###### 5
> I arose to open for my beloved;
> My hands dripped with myrrh—
> My fingers flowed with myrrh
> On the handles of the lock.
###### 6
> I opened for my beloved,
> But my lover had already turned and gone away.
> I fell into despair when he departed.
> I looked for him but did not find him;
> I called him but he did not answer me.
###### 7
> The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city.
> They beat me, they bruised me;
> They took away my cloak, those watchmen on the walls!

O most beautiful of women?
Why is your beloved better than others,

###### 14
