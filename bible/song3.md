# Song of Songs 3
## The Lost Lover is Found
###### ¶ 1
> All night long on my bed
> I longed for my lover.
> I longed for him but he never appeared.
###### 2
> “I will arise and look all around throughout the town,
> “And throughout the streets and squares;
> “I will search for my beloved.”
> I searched for him but I did not find him.
###### 3
> The night watchmen found me—the ones who guard the city walls.
> “Have you seen my beloved?”
###### 4
> Scarcely had I passed them by
> When I found my beloved!
> I held onto him tightly and would not let him go
> Until I brought him to my mother’s house,
> To the bedroom chamber of the one who conceived me.
## The Adjuration Refrain
###### ¶ 5
> I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem,
> By the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields:
> “Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases!”
## The Royal Wedding Procession
###### ¶ 6
> Who is this coming up from the wilderness
> Like a column of smoke,
> Like a fragrant billow of myrrh and frankincense,
> Every kind of fragrant powder of the traveling merchants?
###### 7
> Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch!
> It is surrounded by sixty warriors,
> Some of Israel’s mightiest warriors.
###### 8
> All of them are skilled with a sword,
> Well trained in the art of warfare.
> Each has his sword at his side,
> To guard against the terrors of the night.
###### 9
> King Solomon made a sedan chair for himself
> Of wood imported from Lebanon.
###### 10
> Its posts were made of silver;
> Its back was made of gold.
> Its seat was upholstered with purple wool;
> Its interior was inlaid with leather by the maidens of Jerusalem.
###### 11
> Come out, O maidens of Zion,
> And gaze upon King Solomon!
> He is wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him
> On his wedding day,
> On the most joyous day of his life!
