# Isaiah 4
###### ¶ 1

> “Take away our shame!”
## The Branch of the Lord
###### ¶ 2
> At that time
> The crops given by the LORD will bring admiration and honor;
> The produce of the land will be a source of pride and delight
> To those who remain in Israel.
###### 3
> Those remaining in Zion, those left in Jerusalem,
> Will be called “holy,”
> All in Jerusalem who are destined to live.
###### 4
> At that time the Lord will wash the excrement from Zion’s women,
> He will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem’s midst,
> As he comes to judge
> And to bring devastation.
###### 5
> Then the LORD will create
> Over all Mount Zion
> And over its convocations
> A cloud and smoke by day
> And a bright flame of fire by night;
> Indeed a canopy will accompany the LORD’s glorious presence.
###### 6
> By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat,
> As well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour.
