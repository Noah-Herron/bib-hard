# Psalm 36
###### ¶ 1
> An evil man is rebellious to the core.
> He does not fear God,
###### 2
> For he is too proud
> To recognize and give up his sin.
###### 3
> The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful;
> He does not care about doing what is wise and right.
###### 4
> While he lies in bed he plans ways to sin.
> He is committed to a sinful lifestyle;
> He does not reject what is evil.
###### ¶ 5
> O LORD, your loyal love reaches to the sky,
> Your faithfulness to the clouds.
###### 6
> Your justice is like the highest mountains,
> Your fairness like the deepest sea;
> You, LORD, preserve mankind and the animal kingdom.
###### 7
> How precious is your loyal love, O God!
> The human race finds shelter under your wings.
###### 8
> They are filled with food from your house,
> And you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.
###### 9
> For with you is the fountain of life;
> In your light we see light.
###### ¶ 10
> Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers,
> And vindicate the morally upright.
###### 11
> Do not let arrogant men overtake me,
> Or let evil men make me homeless.
###### 12
> I can see the evildoers! They have fallen.
> They have been knocked down and are unable to get up.
