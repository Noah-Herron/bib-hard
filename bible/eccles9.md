# Ecclesiastes 9
## Everyone Will Die
###### ¶ 1
> So I reflected on all this, attempting to clear it all up.
> I concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works, are in the hand of God;
> Whether a person will be loved or hated—
> No one knows what lies ahead.
###### ¶ 2
> Everyone shares the same fate—
> The righteous and the wicked,
> The good and the bad,
> The ceremonially clean and unclean,
> Those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.
> What happens to the good person, also happens to the sinner;
> What happens to those who make vows, also happens to those who are afraid to make vows.
###### 3
> This is the unfortunate fact about everything that happens on earth:
> The same fate awaits everyone.
> In addition to this, the hearts of all people are full of evil,
> And there is folly in their hearts during their lives—then they die.
## Better to Be Poor but Alive than Rich but Dead
###### 4
> But whoever is among the living has hope;
> A live dog is better than a dead lion.
###### 5
> For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything;
> They have no further reward—and even the memory of them disappears.
###### 6
> What they loved, as well as what they hated and envied, perished long ago,
> And they no longer have a part in anything that happens on earth.
## Life is Brief, so Cherish its Joys
###### ¶ 7
> Go, eat your food with joy,
> And drink your wine with a happy heart,
> Because God has already approved your works.
###### 8
> Let your clothes always be white,
> And do not spare precious ointment on your head.
###### 9
> Enjoy life with your beloved wife during all the days of your fleeting life
> That God has given you on earth during all your fleeting days;
> For that is your reward in life and in your burdensome work on earth.
###### ¶ 10
> Whatever you find to do with your hands,
> Do it with all your might,
> Because there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave,
> The place where you will eventually go.
## Wisdom Cannot Protect against Seemingly Chance Events
###### ¶ 11
> Again, I observed this on the earth:
> The race is not always won by the swiftest,
> The battle is not always won by the strongest;
> Prosperity does not always belong to those who are the wisest,
> Wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning,
> Nor does success always come to those with the most knowledge—
> For time and chance may overcome them all.
###### 12
> Surely, no one knows his appointed time.
> Like fish that are caught in a deadly net, and like birds that are caught in a snare—
> Just like them, all people are ensnared at an unfortunate time that falls upon them suddenly.
## Most People Are Not Receptive to Wise Counsel
###### ¶ 13
> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth,
> And it is a great burden to me:
###### 14
> There was once a small city with a few men in it,
> And a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it.
###### 15
> However, a poor but wise man lived in the city,
> And he could have delivered the city by his wisdom,
> But no one listened to that poor man.
###### 16
> So I concluded that wisdom is better than might,
> But a poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.
## Wisdom versus Fools, Sin, and Folly
###### 17
> The words of the wise are heard in quiet,
> More than the shouting of a ruler is heard among fools.
###### 18
> Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
> But one sinner can destroy much that is good.
