# Isaiah 24
## The Lord Will Judge the Earth
###### ¶ 1
> Look, the LORD is ready to devastate the earth
> And leave it in ruins;
> He will mar its surface
> And scatter its inhabitants.
###### 2
> Everyone will suffer—the priest as well as the people,
> The master as well as the servant,
> The elegant lady as well as the female attendant,
> The seller as well as the buyer,
> The borrower as well as the lender,
> The creditor as well as the debtor.
###### 3
> The earth will be completely devastated
> And thoroughly ransacked.
> For the LORD has decreed this judgment.
###### 4
> The earth dries up and withers,
> The world shrivels up and withers;
> The prominent people of the earth fade away.
###### 5
> The earth is defiled by its inhabitants,
> For they have violated laws,
> Disregarded the regulation,
> And broken the permanent treaty.
###### 6
> So a treaty curse devours the earth;
> Its inhabitants pay for their guilt.
> This is why the inhabitants of the earth disappear,
> And are reduced to just a handful of people.
###### ¶ 7
> The new wine dries up,
> The vines shrivel up,
> All those who like to celebrate groan.
###### 8
> The happy sound of the tambourines stops,
> The revelry of those who celebrate comes to a halt,
> The happy sound of the harp ceases.
###### 9
> They no longer sing and drink wine;
> The beer tastes bitter to those who drink it.
###### 10
> The ruined town is shattered;
> All the houses are shut up tight.
###### 11
> They howl in the streets because of what happened to the wine;
> All joy turns to sorrow;
> Celebrations disappear from the earth.
###### 12
> The city is left in ruins;
> The gate is reduced to rubble.
###### 13
> This is what will happen throughout the earth,
> Among the nations.
> It will be like when they beat an olive tree,
> And just a few olives are left at the end of the harvest.
###### 14
> They lift their voices and shout joyfully;
> They praise the majesty of the LORD in the west.
###### 15
> So in the east extol the LORD,
> Along the seacoasts extol the fame of the LORD God of Israel.
###### 16
> From the ends of the earth we hear songs—
> The Just One is majestic.
> But I say, “I’m wasting away! I’m wasting away! I’m doomed!
> “Deceivers deceive, deceivers thoroughly deceive!”
###### 17
> Terror, pit, and snare
> Are ready to overtake, you inhabitants of the earth!
###### 18
> The one who runs away from the sound of the terror
> Will fall into the pit;
> The one who climbs out of the pit
> Will be trapped by the snare.
> For the floodgates of the heavens are opened up
> And the foundations of the earth shake.
###### 19
> The earth is broken in pieces,
> The earth is ripped to shreds,
> The earth shakes violently.
###### 20
> The earth will stagger around like a drunk;
> It will sway back and forth like a hut in a windstorm.
> Its sin will weigh it down,
> And it will fall and never get up again.
## The Lord Will Become King
###### 21
> At that time the LORD will punish
> The heavenly forces in the heavens
> And the earthly kings on the earth.
###### 22
> They will be imprisoned in a pit,
> Locked up in a prison,
> And after staying there for a long time, they will be punished.
###### 23
> The full moon will be covered up,
> The bright sun will be darkened;
> For the LORD of Heaven’s Armies will rule
> On Mount Zion in Jerusalem
> In the presence of his assembly, in majestic splendor.
