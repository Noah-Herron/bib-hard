# Psalm 109
###### ¶ 1
> O God whom I praise, do not ignore me.
###### 2
> For they say cruel and deceptive things to me;
> They lie to me.
###### 3
> They surround me and say hateful things;
> They attack me for no reason.
###### 4
> They repay my love with accusations,
> But I continue to pray.
###### 5
> They repay me evil for good,
> And hate for love.
###### ¶ 6
> Appoint an evil man to testify against him.
> May an accuser stand at his right side.
###### 7
> When he is judged, he will be found guilty.
> Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful.
###### 8
> May his days be few.
> May another take his job.
###### 9
> May his children be fatherless,
> And his wife a widow.
###### 10
> May his children roam around begging,
> Asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home.
###### 11
> May the creditor seize all he owns.
> May strangers loot his property.
###### 12
> May no one show him kindness.
> May no one have compassion on his fatherless children.
###### 13
> May his descendants be cut off.
> May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives.
###### ¶ 14
> May his ancestors’ sins be remembered by the LORD.
> May his mother’s sin not be forgotten.
###### 15
> May the LORD be constantly aware of them,
> And cut off the memory of his children from the earth.
###### 16
> For he never bothered to show kindness;
> He harassed the oppressed and needy,
> And killed the disheartened.
###### 17
> He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him.
> He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.
###### 18
> He made cursing a way of life,
> So curses poured into his stomach like water
> And seeped into his bones like oil.
###### 19
> May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on,
> Or a belt one wears continually.
###### 20
> May the LORD repay my accusers in this way,
> Those who say evil things about me.
###### ¶ 21
> O Sovereign LORD,
> Intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation.
> Because your loyal love is good, deliver me.
###### 22
> For I am oppressed and needy,
> And my heart beats violently within me.
###### 23
> I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day;
> I am shaken off like a locust.
###### 24
> I am so starved my knees shake;
> I have turned into skin and bones.
###### 25
> I am disdained by them.
> When they see me, they shake their heads.
###### ¶ 26
> Help me, O LORD my God.
> Because you are faithful to me, deliver me.
###### 27
> Then they will realize this is your work,
> And that you, LORD, have accomplished it.
###### 28
> They curse, but you will bless.
> When they attack, they will be humiliated,
> But your servant will rejoice.
###### 29
> My accusers will be covered with shame,
> And draped in humiliation as if it were a robe.
###### ¶ 30
> I will thank the LORD profusely.
> In the middle of a crowd I will praise him,
###### 31
> Because he stands at the right hand of the needy,
> To deliver him from those who threaten his life.
