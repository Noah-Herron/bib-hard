# Job 30
## Job’s Present Misery
###### ¶ 1
> “But now they mock me, those who are younger than I,
> “Whose fathers I disdained too much
> “To put with my sheep dogs.
###### 2
> “Moreover, the strength of their hands—
> “What use was it to me?
> “Those whose strength had perished,
###### 3
> “Gaunt with want and hunger,
> “They would roam the parched land,
> “By night a desolate waste.
###### 4
> “By the brush they would gather herbs from the salt marshes,
> “And the root of the broom tree was their food.
###### 5
> “They were banished from the community—
> “People shouted at them
> “As they would shout at thieves—
###### 6
> “So that they had to live
> “In the dry stream beds,
> “In the holes of the ground, and among the rocks.
###### 7
> “They brayed like animals among the bushes
> “And were huddled together under the nettles.
###### 8
> “Sons of senseless and nameless people,
> “They were driven out of the land with whips.”
## Job’s Indignities
###### ¶ 9
> “And now I have become their taunt song;
> “I have become a byword among them.
###### 10
> “They detest me and maintain their distance;
> “They do not hesitate to spit in my face.
###### 11
> “Because God has untied my tent cord and afflicted me,
> “People throw off all restraint in my presence.
###### 12
> “On my right the young rabble rise up;
> “They drive me from place to place,
> “And build up siege ramps against me.
###### 13
> “They destroy my path;
> “They succeed in destroying me
> “Without anyone assisting them.
###### 14
> “They come in as through a wide breach;
> “Amid the crash they come rolling in.
###### 15
> “Terrors are turned loose on me;
> “They drive away my honor like the wind,
> “And as a cloud my deliverance has passed away.”
## Job’s Despondency
###### ¶ 16
> “And now my soul pours itself out within me;
> “Days of suffering take hold of me.
###### 17
> “Night pierces my bones;
> “My gnawing pains never cease.
###### 18
> “With great power God grasps my clothing;
> “He binds me like the collar of my tunic.
###### 19
> “He has flung me into the mud,
> “And I have come to resemble dust and ashes.
###### 20
> “I cry out to you, but you do not answer me;
> “I stand up, and you only look at me.
###### 21
> “You have become cruel to me;
> “With the strength of your hand you attack me.
###### 22
> “You pick me up on the wind and make me ride on it;
> “You toss me about in the storm.
###### 23
> “I know that you are bringing me to death,
> “To the meeting place for all the living.”
## The Contrast With the Past
###### ¶ 24
> “Surely one does not stretch out his hand
> “Against a broken man
> “When he cries for help in his distress.
###### 25
> “Have I not wept for the unfortunate?
> “Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
###### 26
> “But when I hoped for good, trouble came;
> “When I expected light, then darkness came.
###### 27
> “My heart is in turmoil unceasingly;
> “The days of my affliction confront me.
###### 28
> “I go about blackened, but not by the sun;
> “In the assembly I stand up and cry for help.
###### 29
> “I have become a brother to jackals
> “And a companion of ostriches.
###### 30
> “My skin has turned dark on me;
> “My body is hot with fever.
###### 31
> “My harp is used for mourning
> “And my flute for the sound of weeping.
