# Job 10
## An Appeal for Revelation
###### ¶ 1
> “I am weary of my life;
> “I will complain freely without restraint;
> “I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
###### 2
> “I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;
> ‘Tell me why you are contending with me.’
###### 3
> “Is it good for you to oppress,
> “To despise the work of your hands,
> “While you smile
> “On the schemes of the wicked?”
## Motivations of God
###### 4
> “Do you have eyes of flesh,
> “Or do you see as a human being sees?
###### 5
> “Are your days like the days of a mortal,
> “Or your years like the years of a mortal,
###### 6
> “That you must search out my iniquity,
> “And inquire about my sin,
###### 7
> “Although you know that I am not guilty,
> “And that there is no one who can deliver
> “Out of your hand?”
## Contradictions in God’s Dealings
###### ¶ 8
> “Your hands have shaped me and made me,
> “But now you destroy me completely.
###### 9
> “Remember that you have made me as with the clay;
> “Will you return me to dust?
###### 10
> “Did you not pour me out like milk,
> “And curdle me like cheese?
###### 11
> “You clothed me with skin and flesh
> “And knit me together with bones and sinews.
###### 12
> “You gave me life and favor,
> “And your intervention watched over my spirit.
###### 13
> “But these things you have concealed in your heart;
> “I know that this is with you:
###### 14
> “If I sinned, then you would watch me
> “And you would not acquit me of my iniquity.
###### 15
> “If I am guilty, woe to me,
> “And if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head;
> “I am full of shame,
> “And satiated with my affliction.
###### 16
> “If I lift myself up,
> “You hunt me as a fierce lion,
> “And again you display your power against me.
###### 17
> “You bring new witnesses against me,
> “And increase your anger against me;
> “Relief troops come against me.”
## An Appeal for Relief
###### ¶ 18
> “Why then did you bring me out from the womb?
> “I should have died
> “And no eye would have seen me!
###### 19
> “I should have been as though I had never existed;
> “I should have been carried
> “Right from the womb to the grave!
###### 20
> “Are not my days few?
> “Cease, then, and leave me alone
> “That I may find a little comfort,
###### 21
> “Before I depart, never to return,
> “To the land of darkness
> “And the deepest shadow,
###### 22
> “To the land of utter darkness,
> “Like the deepest darkness,
> “And the deepest shadow and disorder,
> “Where even the light is like darkness.”
