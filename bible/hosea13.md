# Hosea 13
## Baal Worshipers and Calf Worshipers to be Destroyed
###### ¶ 1
> When Ephraim spoke, there was terror;
> He was exalted in Israel,
> But he became guilty by worshiping Baal and died.
###### 2
> Even now they persist in sin!
> They make metal images for themselves,
> Idols that they skillfully fashion from their own silver;
> All of them are nothing but the work of craftsmen.
> There is a saying about them:
> “Those who sacrifice to the calf idol are calf kissers!”
###### 3
> Therefore they will disappear like the morning mist,
> Like early morning dew that evaporates,
> Like chaff that is blown away from a threshing floor,
> Like smoke that disappears through an open window.
## Well-Fed Israel Will Be Fed to Wild Animals
###### ¶ 4
> But I am the LORD your God,
> Who brought you out of Egypt.
> Therefore, you must not acknowledge any God but me.
> Except for me there is no Savior.
###### 5
> I cared for you in the wilderness,
> In the dry desert where no water was.
###### 6
> When they were fed, they became satisfied;
> When they were satisfied, they became proud;
> As a result, they forgot me!
###### 7
> So I will pounce on them like a lion;
> Like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
###### 8
> I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs—
> I will rip open their chests.
> I will devour them there like a lion—
> Like a wild animal would tear them apart.
## Israel’s King Unable to Deliver the Nation
###### ¶ 9
> I will destroy you, O Israel!
> Who is there to help you?
###### 10
> Where then is your king,
> That he may save you in all your cities?
> Where are your rulers for whom you asked, saying,
> “Give me a king and princes”?
###### 11
> I granted you a king in my anger,
> And I will take him away in my wrath!
## Israel’s Punishment Will Not Be Withheld Much Longer
###### ¶ 12
> The punishment of Ephraim has been decreed;
> His punishment is being stored up for the future.
###### 13
> The labor pains of a woman will overtake him,
> But the baby will lack wisdom;
> When the time arrives,
> He will not come out of the womb!
## The Lord Will Not Relent from the Threatened Judgment
###### 14
> Will I deliver them from the power of Sheol? No, I will not!
> Will I redeem them from death? No, I will not!
> O Death, bring on your plagues!
> O Sheol, bring on your destruction!
> My eyes will not show any compassion!
## The Capital of the Northern Empire Will Be Destroyed
###### ¶ 15
> Even though he flourishes like a reed plant,
> A scorching east wind will come,
> A wind from the LORD rising up from the desert.
> As a result, his spring will dry up;
> His well will become dry.
> That wind will spoil all his delightful foods
> In the containers in his storehouse.
###### 16
>  Samaria will be held guilty,
> Because she rebelled against her God.
> They will fall by the sword;
> Their infants will be dashed to the ground—
> Their pregnant women will be ripped open.
