# Isaiah 57
###### ¶ 1
> The godly perish,
> But no one cares.
> Honest people disappear,
> When no one minds
> That the godly disappear because of evil.
###### 2
> Those who live uprightly enter a place of peace;
> They rest on their beds.
###### 3
> “But approach, you sons of omen readers,
> “You offspring of adulteresses and prostitutes!
###### 4
> “At whom are you laughing?
> “At whom are you opening your mouth
> “And sticking out your tongue?
> “You are the children of rebels,
> “The offspring of liars,
###### 5
> “You who inflame your lusts among the oaks and under every green tree,
> “Who slaughter children near the streams under the rocky overhangs.
###### 6
> “Among the smooth stones of the stream are the idols you love;
> “They, they are the object of your devotion.
> “You pour out liquid offerings to them,
> “You make an offering.
> “Because of these things how can I relent from judgment?
###### 7
> “On every high, elevated hill you prepare your bed;
> “You go up there to offer sacrifices.
###### 8
> “Behind the door and doorpost you put your symbols.
> “Indeed, you depart from me and go up
> “And invite them into bed with you.
> “You purchase favors from them;
> “You love their bed,
> “And gaze longingly on their naked bodies.
###### 9
> “You take olive oil as tribute to your king,
> “Along with many perfumes.
> “You send your messengers to a distant place;
> “You go all the way to Sheol.
###### 10
> “Because of the long distance you must travel, you get tired,
> “But you do not say, ‘I give up.’
> “You get renewed energy,
> “So you don’t collapse.
###### ¶ 11
> “Whom are you worried about?
> “Whom do you fear, that you would act so deceitfully
> “And not remember me
> “Or think about me?
> “Because I have been silent for so long,
> “You are not afraid of me.
###### 12
> “I will denounce your so-called righteousness and your deeds,
> “But they will not help you.
###### 13
> “When you cry out for help, let your idols help you!
> “The wind blows them all away,
> “A breeze carries them away.
> “But the one who looks to me for help will inherit the land
> “And will have access to my holy mountain.”
###### ¶ 14
> He says,
> “Build it! Build it! Clear a way!
> “Remove all the obstacles out of the way of my people!”
###### 15
> For this is what the high and exalted one says,
> The one who rules forever, whose name is holy:
> “I dwell in an exalted and holy place,
> “But also with the discouraged and humiliated,
> “In order to cheer up the humiliated
> “And to encourage the discouraged.
###### 16
> “For I will not be hostile forever
> “Or perpetually angry,
> “For then man’s spirit would grow faint before me,
> “The life-giving breath I created.
###### 17
> “I was angry because of their sinful greed;
> “I attacked them and angrily rejected them,
> “Yet they remained disobedient and stubborn.
###### 18
> “I have seen their behavior,
> “But I will heal them. I will lead them,
> “And I will provide comfort to them and those who mourn with them.
###### 19
> “I am the one who gives them reason to celebrate.
> “Complete prosperity is available both to those who are far away and those who are nearby,”
> Says the LORD, “and I will heal them.
###### 20
> “But the wicked are like a surging sea
> “That is unable to be quiet;
> “Its waves toss up mud and sand.
###### 21
> “There will be no prosperity,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
