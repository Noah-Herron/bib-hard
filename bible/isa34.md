# Isaiah 34
## The Lord Will Judge Edom
###### ¶ 1
> Come near, you nations, and listen!
> Pay attention, you people!
> The earth and everything it contains must listen,
> The world and everything that lives in it.
###### 2
> For the LORD is angry at all the nations
> And furious with all their armies.
> He will annihilate them and slaughter them.
###### 3
> Their slain will be left unburied,
> Their corpses will stink;
> The hills will soak up their blood.
###### 4
> All the stars in the sky will fade away,
> The sky will roll up like a scroll;
> All its stars will wither,
> Like a leaf withers and falls from a vine
> Or a fig withers and falls from a tree.
###### 5
> He says, “Indeed, my sword has slaughtered heavenly powers.
> “Look, it now descends on Edom,
> “On the people I will annihilate in judgment.”
###### 6
> The LORD’s sword is dripping with blood,
> It is covered with fat;
> It drips with the blood of young rams and goats
> And is covered with the fat of rams’ kidneys.
> For the LORD is holding a sacrifice in Bozrah,
> A bloody slaughter in the land of Edom.
###### 7
> Wild oxen will be slaughtered along with them,
> As well as strong bulls.
> Their land is drenched with blood,
> Their soil is covered with fat.
###### 8
> For the LORD has planned a day of revenge,
> A time when he will repay Edom for her hostility toward Zion.
###### 9
> Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch
> And her soil into brimstone;
> Her land will become burning pitch.
###### 10
> Night and day it will burn;
> Its smoke will ascend continually.
> Generation after generation it will be a wasteland,
> And no one will ever pass through it again.
###### 11
> Owls and wild animals will live there,
> All kinds of wild birds will settle in it.
> The LORD will stretch out over her
> The measuring line of ruin
> And the plumb line of destruction.
###### 12
> Her nobles will have nothing left to call a kingdom,
> And all her officials will disappear.
###### 13
> Her fortresses will be overgrown with thorns;
> Thickets and weeds will grow in her fortified cities.
> Jackals will settle there;
> Ostriches will live there.
###### 14
> Wild animals and wild dogs will congregate there;
> Wild goats will bleat to one another.
> Yes, nocturnal animals will rest there
> And make for themselves a nest.
###### 15
> Owls will make nests and lay eggs there;
> They will hatch them and protect them.
> Yes, hawks will gather there,
> Each with its mate.
###### ¶ 16
> Carefully read the scroll of the LORD!
> Not one of these creatures will be missing,
> None will lack a mate.
> For the LORD has issued the decree,
> And his own spirit gathers them.
###### 17
> He assigns them their allotment;
> He measures out their assigned place.
> They will live there permanently;
> They will settle in it through successive generations.
