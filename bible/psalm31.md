# Psalm 31
###### ¶ 1
> In you, O LORD, I have taken shelter.
> Never let me be humiliated.
> Vindicate me by rescuing me.
###### 2
> Listen to me.
> Quickly deliver me.
> Be my protector and refuge,
> A stronghold where I can be safe.
###### 3
> For you are my high ridge and my stronghold;
> For the sake of your own reputation you lead me and guide me.
###### 4
> You will free me from the net they hid for me,
> For you are my place of refuge.
###### 5
> Into your hand I entrust my life;
> You will rescue me, O LORD, the faithful God.
###### ¶ 6
> I hate those who serve worthless idols,
> But I trust in the LORD.
###### 7
> I will be happy and rejoice in your faithfulness,
> Because you notice my pain
> And you are aware of how distressed I am.
###### 8
> You do not deliver me over to the power of the enemy;
> You enable me to stand in a wide open place.
###### ¶ 9
> Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am in distress!
> My eyes grow dim from suffering.
> I have lost my strength.
###### 10
> For my life nears its end in pain;
> My years draw to a close as I groan.
> My strength fails me because of my sin,
> And my bones become brittle.
###### 11
> Because of all my enemies, people disdain me;
> My neighbors are appalled by my suffering—
> Those who know me are horrified by my condition;
> Those who see me in the street run away from me.
###### 12
> I am forgotten, like a dead man no one thinks about;
> I am regarded as worthless, like a broken jar.
###### 13
> For I hear what so many are saying,
> The terrifying news that comes from every direction.
> When they plot together against me,
> They figure out how they can take my life.
###### ¶ 14
> But I trust in you, O LORD!
> I declare, “You are my God!”
###### 15
> You determine my destiny.
> Rescue me from the power of my enemies and those who chase me.
###### 16
> Smile on your servant.
> Deliver me because of your faithfulness.
###### 17
> O LORD, do not let me be humiliated,
> For I call out to you.
> May evil men be humiliated.
> May they go wailing to the grave.
###### 18
> May lying lips be silenced—
> Lips that speak defiantly against the innocent
> With arrogance and contempt.
###### ¶ 19
> How great is your favor,
> Which you store up for your loyal followers.
> In plain sight of everyone you bestow it on those who take shelter in you.
###### 20
> You hide them with you, where they are safe from the attacks of men;
> You conceal them in a shelter, where they are safe from slanderous attacks.
###### 21
> The LORD deserves praise
> For he demonstrated his amazing faithfulness to me when I was besieged by enemies.
###### 22
> I jumped to conclusions and said,
> “I am cut off from your presence!”
> But you heard my plea for mercy when I cried out to you for help.
###### ¶ 23
> Love the LORD, all you faithful followers of his!
> The LORD protects those who have integrity,
> But he pays back in full the one who acts arrogantly.
###### 24
> Be strong and confident,
> All you who wait on the LORD.
