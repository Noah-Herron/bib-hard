# Psalm 32
###### ¶ 1
> How blessed is the one whose rebellious acts are forgiven,
> Whose sin is pardoned.
###### 2
> How blessed is the one whose wrongdoing the LORD does not punish,
> In whose spirit there is no deceit.
###### ¶ 3
> When I refused to confess my sin,
> My whole body wasted away,
> While I groaned in pain all day long.
###### 4
> For day and night you tormented me;
> You tried to destroy me in the intense heat of summer. (Selah)
###### 5
> Then I confessed my sin;
> I no longer covered up my wrongdoing.
> I said, “I will confess my rebellious acts to the LORD.”
> And then you forgave my sins. (Selah)
###### 6
> For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you
> While there is a window of opportunity.
> Certainly when the surging water rises,
> It will not reach them.
###### 7
> You are my hiding place;
> You protect me from distress.
> You surround me with shouts of joy from those celebrating deliverance. (Selah)
###### ¶ 8
> I will instruct and teach you about how you should live.
> I will advise you as I look you in the eye.
###### 9
> Do not be like an unintelligent horse or mule,
> Which will not obey you
> Unless they are controlled by a bridle and bit.
###### 10
> An evil person suffers much pain,
> But the LORD’s faithfulness overwhelms the one who trusts in him.
###### 11
> Rejoice in the LORD and be happy, you who are godly!
> Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright!
