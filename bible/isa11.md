# Isaiah 11
## An Ideal King Establishes a Kingdom of Peace
###### ¶ 1
> A shoot will grow out of Jesse’s root stock,
> A bud will sprout from his roots.
###### 2
> The LORD’s Spirit will rest on him—
> A Spirit that gives extraordinary wisdom,
> A Spirit that provides the ability to execute plans,
> A Spirit that produces absolute loyalty to the LORD.
###### 3
> He will take delight in obeying the LORD.
> He will not judge by mere appearances,
> Or make decisions on the basis of hearsay.
###### 4
> He will treat the poor fairly,
> And make right decisions for the downtrodden of the earth.
> He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,
> And order the wicked to be executed.
###### 5
> Justice will be like a belt around his waist,
> Integrity will be like a belt around his hips.
###### ¶ 6
> A wolf will reside with a lamb,
> And a leopard will lie down with a young goat;
> An ox and a young lion will graze together,
> As a small child leads them along.
###### 7
> A cow and a bear will graze together,
> Their young will lie down together.
> A lion, like an ox, will eat straw.
###### 8
> A baby will play
> Over the hole of a snake;
> Over the nest of a serpent
> An infant will put his hand.
###### 9
> They will no longer injure or destroy
> On my entire royal mountain.
> For there will be universal submission to the LORD’s sovereignty,
> Just as the waters completely cover the sea.
## Israel is Reclaimed and Reunited
###### ¶ 10
At that time a root from Jesse will stand like a signal flag for the nations. Nations will look to him for guidance, and his residence will be majestic.
###### ¶ 11
At that time the Lord will again lift his hand to reclaim the remnant of his people from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the seacoasts.
###### 12
> He will lift a signal flag for the nations;
> He will gather Israel’s dispersed people
> And assemble Judah’s scattered people
> From the four corners of the earth.
###### 13
> Ephraim’s jealousy will end,
> And Judah’s hostility will be eliminated.
> Ephraim will no longer be jealous of Judah,
> And Judah will no longer be hostile toward Ephraim.
###### 14
> They will swoop down on the Philistine hills to the west;
> Together they will loot the people of the east.
> They will take over Edom and Moab,
> And the Ammonites will be their subjects.
###### 15
> The LORD will divide the gulf of the Egyptian Sea;
> He will wave his hand over the Euphrates River and send a strong wind;
> He will turn it into seven dried-up streams,
> And enable them to walk across in their sandals.
###### 16
> There will be a highway leading out of Assyria
> For the remnant of his people,
> Just as there was for Israel,
> When they went up from the land of Egypt.
