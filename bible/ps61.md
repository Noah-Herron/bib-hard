###### ¶ 1
> O God, hear my cry for help.
> Pay attention to my prayer.
###### 2

###### 3

> A strong tower that protects me from the enemy.
###### 4

> I will find shelter in the protection of your wings. (Selah)

> Make his lifetime span several generations.
###### 7
> May he reign forever before God.
> Decree that your loyal love and faithfulness should protect him.
###### 8
> Then I will sing praises to your name continually,
> As I fulfill my vows day after day.
