> “Weapons of violence are their knives!
###### 6
> “O my soul, do not come into their council,
> “Do not be united to their assembly, my heart,
> “For in their anger they have killed men,
> “And for pleasure they have hamstrung oxen.
###### 7

> “From the prey, my son, you have gone up.
> “He crouches and lies down like a lion;
> “Like a lioness—who will rouse him?
###### 10

> “Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
> “Until he comes to whom it belongs;
> “The nations will obey him.

> “And his teeth white from milk.
###### ¶ 13

> “And become a slave laborer.
###### ¶ 16
> “Dan will judge his people
> “As one of the tribes of Israel.
###### 17

> “Who will help you,
> “Because of the Sovereign God,
> “Who will bless you
> “With blessings from the sky above,
> “Blessings from the deep that lies below,

###### ¶ 28
These are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He gave each of them an appropriate blessing.
###### 29
Then he instructed them, “I am about to go to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
###### 30
“It is the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought for a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite.
###### 31
“There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah; there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah; and there I buried Leah.
###### 32
“The field and the cave in it were acquired from the sons of Heth.”
###### 33
When Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons, he pulled his feet up onto the bed, breathed his last breath, and went to his people.
