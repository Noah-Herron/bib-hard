# Lamentations 4
## The Prophet Speaks
###### ¶ 1
> Alas! Gold has lost its luster;
> Pure gold loses value.
> Jewels are scattered
> On every street corner.
###### 2
> The precious sons of Zion
> Were worth their weight in gold—
> Alas!—but now they are treated like broken clay pots,
> Made by a potter.
###### 3
> Even the jackals nurse their young
> At their breast,
> But my people are cruel,
> Like ostriches in the wilderness.
###### 4
> The infant’s tongue sticks
> To the roof of its mouth due to thirst;
> Little children beg for bread,
> But no one gives them even a morsel.
###### 5
> Those who once feasted on delicacies
> Are now starving to death in the streets.
> Those who grew up wearing expensive clothes
> Are now dying amid garbage.
###### 6
> The punishment of my people
> Exceeds that of Sodom,
> Which was overthrown in a moment
> With no one to help her.
###### 7
> Our consecrated ones were brighter than snow,
> Whiter than milk;
> Their bodies more ruddy than corals,
> Their hair like lapis lazuli.
###### 8
> Now their appearance is darker than soot;
> They are not recognized in the streets.
> Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
> It is dried up, like tree bark.
###### 9
> Those who die by the sword are better off
> Than those who die of hunger,
> Those who waste away,
> Struck down from lack of food.
###### 10
> The hands of tenderhearted women
> Cooked their own children,
> Who became their food,
> When my people were destroyed.
###### 11
> The LORD fully vented his wrath;
> He poured out his fierce anger.
> He started a fire in Zion;
> It consumed her foundations.
###### 12
> Neither the kings of the earth
> Nor the people of the lands ever thought
> That enemy or foe could enter
> The gates of Jerusalem.
###### 13
> But it happened due to the sins of her prophets
> And the iniquities of her priests,
> Who poured out in her midst
> The blood of the righteous.
###### 14
> They wander blindly through the streets,
> Defiled by the blood they shed,
> While no one dares
> To touch their garments.
###### 15
> People cry to them, “Turn away! You are unclean!
> “Turn away! Turn away! Don’t touch us!”
> So they have fled and wander about;
> But the nations say, “They may not stay here any longer.”
###### 16
> The LORD himself has scattered them;
> He no longer watches over them.
> They did not honor the priests;
> They did not show favor to the elders.
## The People of Jerusalem Lament
###### 17
> Our eyes continually failed us
> As we looked in vain for help.
> From our watchtowers we watched
> For a nation that could not rescue us.
###### 18
> Our enemies hunted us down at every step
> So that we could not walk about in our streets.
> Our end drew near, our days were numbered,
> For our end had come!
###### 19
> Those who pursued us were swifter
> Than eagles in the sky.
> They chased us over the mountains;
> They ambushed us in the wilderness.
###### 20
> Our very life breath—the LORD’s anointed king—
> Was caught in their traps,
> Of whom we thought,
> “Under his protection we will survive among the nations.”
## The Prophet Speaks
###### 21
> Rejoice and be glad for now, O people of Edom,
> Who reside in the land of Uz.
> But the cup of judgment will pass to you also;
> You will get drunk and take off your clothes.
###### 22
> O people of Zion, your punishment will come to an end;
> He will not prolong your exile.
> But, O people of Edom, he will punish your sin
> And reveal your offenses!
