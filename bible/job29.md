## Job Recalls His Former Condition
###### ¶ 1
Then Job continued his speech:
###### 2
> “O that I could be as I was
> “In the months now gone,
> “In the days when God watched over me,
###### 3
> “When he caused his lamp
> “To shine upon my head,
> “And by his light
> “I walked through darkness;
###### 4
> “Just as I was in my most productive time,
> “When God’s intimate friendship was experienced in my tent,
###### 5
> “When the Almighty was still with me
> “And my children were around me;
###### 6
> “When my steps were bathed with butter
> “And the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil!
###### 7
> “When I went out to the city gate
> “And secured my seat in the public square,
###### 8
> “The young men would see me and step aside,
> “And the old men would get up and remain standing;
###### 9
> “The chief men refrained from talking
> “And covered their mouths with their hands;
###### 10
> “The voices of the nobles fell silent,
> “And their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.”
## Job’s Benevolence
###### 11
> “As soon as the ear heard these things, it blessed me,
> “And when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me,
###### 12
> “For I rescued the poor who cried out for help,
> “And the orphan who had no one to assist him;
###### 13
> “The blessing of the dying man descended on me,
> “And I made the widow’s heart rejoice;
###### 14
> “I put on righteousness and it clothed me,
> “My just dealing was like a robe and a turban;
###### 15
> “I was eyes for the blind
> “And feet for the lame;
###### 16
> “I was a father to the needy,
> “And I investigated the case of the person I did not know;
###### 17
> “I broke the fangs of the wicked,
> “And made him drop his prey from his teeth.”
## Job’s Confidence
###### 18
> “Then I thought, ‘I will die in my own home,
> ‘My days as numerous as the grains of sand.
###### 19
> ‘My roots reach the water,
> ‘And the dew lies on my branches all night long.
###### 20
> ‘My glory will always be fresh in me,
> ‘And my bow ever new in my hand.’
## Job’s Reputation
###### ¶ 21
> “People listened to me and waited silently;
> “They kept silent for my advice.
###### 22
> “After I had spoken, they did not respond;
> “My words fell on them drop by drop.
###### 23
> “They waited for me as people wait for the rain,
> “And they opened their mouths as for the spring rains.
###### 24
> “If I smiled at them, they hardly believed it;
> “And they did not cause the light of my face to darken.
###### 25
> “I chose the way for them
> “And sat as their chief;
> “I lived like a king among his troops;
> “I was like one who comforts mourners.
