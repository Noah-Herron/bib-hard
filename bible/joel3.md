# Joel 3
## The LORD Plans to Judge the Nations
###### ¶ 1
>  For look! In those days and at that time
> I will return the exiles to Judah and Jerusalem.
###### 2
> Then I will gather all the nations,
> And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
> I will enter into judgment against them there
> Concerning my people Israel who are my inheritance,
> Whom they scattered among the nations.
> They partitioned my land,
###### 3
> And they cast lots for my people.
> They traded a boy for a prostitute;
> They sold a little girl for wine so they could drink.
###### 4
> Why are you doing these things to me, Tyre and Sidon?
> Are you trying to get even with me, land of Philistia?
> If you are, I will very quickly repay you for what you have done!
###### 5
> For you took my silver and my gold
> And brought my precious valuables to your own palaces.
###### 6
> You sold Judeans and Jerusalemites to the Greeks,
> Removing them far from their own country.
###### 7
> Look! I am rousing them from that place to which you sold them.
> I will repay you for what you have done!
###### 8
> I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah.
> They will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.
> Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
## Judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat
###### ¶ 9
> Proclaim this among the nations:
> “Prepare for a holy war!
> “Call out the warriors!
> “Let all these fighting men approach and attack!
###### 10
> “Beat your plowshares into swords,
> “And your pruning hooks into spears.
> “Let the weak say, ‘I too am a warrior!’
###### 11
> “Lend your aid and come,
> “All you surrounding nations,
> “And gather yourselves to that place.”
> Bring down, O LORD, your warriors!
###### 12
> “Let the nations be roused and let them go up
> “To the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
> “For there I will sit in judgment on all the surrounding nations.
###### 13
> “Rush forth with the sickle, for the harvest is ripe!
> “Come, stomp the grapes, for the winepress is full!
> “The vats overflow.
> “Indeed, their evil is great!”
###### 14
> Crowds, great crowds are in the Valley of Decision,
> For the day of the LORD is near in the Valley of Decision!
###### 15
> The sun and moon are darkened;
> The stars withhold their brightness.
###### 16
> The LORD roars from Zion;
> From Jerusalem his voice bellows out.
> The heavens and the earth shake.
> But the LORD is a refuge for his people;
> He is a stronghold for the citizens of Israel.
## The Lord’s Presence in Zion
###### 17
> “You will be convinced that I the LORD am your God,
> “Dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain.
> “Jerusalem will be holy—
> “Conquering armies will no longer pass through it.
###### ¶ 18
> “On that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
> “And the hills will flow with milk.
> “All the dry stream beds of Judah will flow with water.
> “A spring will flow out from the temple of the LORD,
> “Watering the Valley of Acacia Trees.
###### 19
> “Egypt will be desolate
> “And Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
> “Because of the violence they did to the people of Judah,
> “In whose land they shed innocent blood.
###### 20
> “But Judah will reside securely forever,
> “And Jerusalem will be secure from one generation to the next.
###### 21
> “I will avenge their blood that I had not previously acquitted.
> “It is the LORD who dwells in Zion!
