# Lamentations 2
## The Prophet Speaks
###### ¶ 1
> Alas! The Lord has covered
> Daughter Zion with his anger.
> He has thrown down the splendor of Israel
> From heaven to earth;
> He did not protect his temple
> When he displayed his anger.
###### 2
> The Lord destroyed mercilessly
> All the homes of Jacob’s descendants.
> In his anger he tore down
> The fortified cities of Daughter Judah.
> He knocked to the ground and humiliated
> The kingdom and its rulers.
###### 3
> In fierce anger he destroyed
> The whole army of Israel.
> He withdrew his right hand
> As the enemy attacked.
> He was like a raging fire in the land of Jacob;
> It consumed everything around it.
###### 4
> He prepared his bow like an enemy;
> His right hand was ready to shoot.
> Like a foe he killed everyone,
> Even our strong young men;
> He has poured out his anger like fire
> On the tent of Daughter Zion.
###### 5
> The Lord, like an enemy,
> Destroyed Israel.
> He destroyed all her palaces;
> He ruined her fortified cities.
> He made everyone in Daughter Judah
> Mourn and lament.
###### 6
> He destroyed his temple as if it were a vineyard;
> He destroyed his appointed meeting place.
> The LORD has made those in Zion forget
> Both the festivals and the Sabbaths.
> In his fierce anger he has spurned
> Both king and priest.
###### 7
> The Lord rejected his altar
> And abhorred his temple.
> He handed over to the enemy
> Jerusalem’s palace walls;
> The enemy shouted in the LORD’s temple
> As if it were a feast day.
###### 8
> The LORD was determined to tear down
> Daughter Zion’s wall.
> He prepared to knock it down;
> He did not withdraw his hand from destroying.
> He made the ramparts and fortified walls lament;
> Together they mourned their ruin.
###### 9
> Her city gates have fallen to the ground;
> He smashed to bits the bars that lock her gates.
> Her king and princes were taken into exile;
> There is no more guidance available.
> As for her prophets,
> They no longer receive a vision from the LORD.
###### 10
> The elders of Daughter Zion
> Sit on the ground in silence.
> They have thrown dirt on their heads;
> They have dressed in sackcloth.
> Jerusalem’s young women stare down at the ground.
###### 11
> My eyes are worn out from weeping;
> My stomach is in knots.
> My heart is poured out on the ground
> Due to the destruction of my helpless people;
> Children and infants faint
> In the town squares.
###### 12
> Children say to their mothers,
> “Where are food and drink?”
> They faint like a wounded warrior
> In the city squares.
> They die slowly
> In their mothers’ arms.
###### 13
> With what can I equate you?
> To what can I compare you, O Daughter Jerusalem?
> To what can I liken you
> So that I might comfort you, O Virgin Daughter Zion?
> Your wound is as deep as the sea.
> Who can heal you?
###### 14
> Your prophets saw visions for you
> That were worthless whitewash.
> They failed to expose your sin
> So as to restore your fortunes.
> They saw oracles for you
> That were worthless lies.
###### 15
> All who passed by on the road
> Clapped their hands to mock you.
> They sneered and shook their heads
> At Daughter Jerusalem.
> “Ha! Is this the city they called
> ‘The perfection of beauty,
> ‘The source of joy of the whole earth!’?”
###### 16
> All your enemies
> Gloated over you.
> They sneered and gnashed their teeth;
> They said, “We have destroyed her!
> “Ha! We have waited a long time for this day.
> “We have lived to see it!”
###### 17
> The LORD has done what he planned;
> He has fulfilled his promise
> That he threatened long ago:
> He has overthrown you without mercy
> And has enabled the enemy to gloat over you;
> He has exalted your adversaries’ power.
###### 18
> Cry out from your heart to the Lord,
> O wall of Daughter Zion!
> Make your tears flow like a river
> All day and all night long!
> Do not rest;
> Do not let your tears stop!
###### 19
> Get up! Cry out in the night
> When the night watches start!
> Pour out your heart like water
> Before the face of the Lord!
> Lift up your hands to him
> For your children’s lives;
> They are fainting from hunger
> At every street corner.
## Jerusalem Speaks
###### 20
> Look, O Lord! Consider!
> Whom have you ever afflicted like this?
> Should women eat their offspring,
> Their healthy infants?
> Should priest and prophet
> Be killed in the Lord’s sanctuary?
###### 21
> The young boys and old men
> Lie dead on the ground in the streets.
> My young women and my young men
> Have fallen by the sword.
> You killed them when you were angry;
> You slaughtered them without mercy.
###### 22
> As if it were a feast day, you call
> Enemies to terrify me on every side.
> On the day of the LORD’s anger
> No one escaped or survived.
> My enemy has finished off
> Those healthy infants whom I bore and raised.
