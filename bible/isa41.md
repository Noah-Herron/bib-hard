# Isaiah 41
## The Lord Challenges the Nations
###### ¶ 1
> “Listen to me in silence, you coastlands!
> “Let the nations find renewed strength!
> “Let them approach and then speak;
> “Let us come together for debate.
###### 2
> “Who stirs up this one from the east?
> “Who officially commissions him for service?
> “He hands nations over to him,
> “And enables him to subdue kings.
> “He makes them like dust with his sword,
> “Like windblown straw with his bow.
###### 3
> “He pursues them and passes by unharmed;
> “He advances with great speed.
###### 4
> “Who acts and carries out decrees?
> “Who summons the successive generations from the beginning?
> “I, the LORD, am present at the very beginning,
> “And at the very end—I am the one.
###### ¶ 5
> “The coastlands see and are afraid;
> “The whole earth trembles;
> “They approach and come.
###### 6
> “They help one another;
> “One says to the other, ‘Be strong!’
###### 7
> “The craftsman encourages the metalsmith,
> “The one who wields the hammer encourages the one who pounds on the anvil.
> “He approves the quality of the welding,
> “And nails it down so it won’t fall over.”

###### 15

> “New and double-edged.
> “You will thresh the mountains and crush them;
> “You will make the hills like straw.
###### 16

> “The wind will scatter them.
> “You will rejoice in the LORD;
> “You will boast in the Holy One of Israel.
###### ¶ 17
> “The oppressed and the poor look for water, but there is none;
> “Their tongues are parched from thirst.
> “I, the LORD, will respond to their prayers;
> “I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.
###### 18
> “I will make streams flow down the slopes
> “And produce springs in the middle of the valleys.
> “I will turn the wilderness into a pool of water
> “And the arid land into springs.
###### 19
> “I will make cedars, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees grow in the wilderness;
> “I will make evergreens, firs, and cypresses grow together in the arid rift valley.
###### 20
> “I will do this so people will observe and recognize,
> “So they will pay attention and understand
> “That the LORD’s power has accomplished this,
> “And that the Holy One of Israel has brought it into being.”
## The Lord Challenges the Pagan Gods
###### ¶ 21
> “Present your argument,” says the LORD.
> “Produce your evidence,” says Jacob’s king.
###### 22
> “Let them produce evidence! Let them tell us what will happen!
> “Tell us about your earlier predictive oracles,
> “So we may examine them and see how they were fulfilled.
> “Or decree for us some future events!
###### 23
> “Predict how future events will turn out,
> “So we might know you are gods.
> “Yes, do something good or something bad,
> “So we might be frightened and in awe.
###### 24
> “Look, you are nothing, and your accomplishments are nonexistent;
> “The one who chooses to worship you is disgusting.
###### ¶ 25
> “I have stirred up one out of the north and he advances,
> “One from the eastern horizon who prays in my name.
> “He steps on rulers as if they were clay,
> “Like a potter treading the clay.
###### 26
> “Who decreed this from the beginning, so we could know?
> “Who announced it ahead of time, so we could say, ‘He’s correct’?
> “Indeed, none of them decreed it.
> “Indeed, none of them announced it.
> “Indeed, no one heard you say anything!
###### 27
> “I first decreed to Zion, ‘Look, here’s what will happen!’
> “I sent a herald to Jerusalem.
###### 28
> “I look, but there is no one,
> “Among them there is no one who serves as an adviser,
> “That I might ask questions and receive answers.
###### 29
> “Look, all of them are nothing,
> “Their accomplishments are nonexistent;
> “Their metal images lack any real substance.
