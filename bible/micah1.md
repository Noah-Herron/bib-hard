## The Judge is Coming
###### 2
> Listen, all you nations!
> Pay attention, all inhabitants of earth!
> The Sovereign LORD will act as a witness against you;
> The Lord will accuse you from his majestic palace.
###### 3
> Look, the LORD is coming out of his dwelling place!
> He will descend and march on the earth’s mountaintops!
###### 4
> The mountains will crumble beneath him,
> And the valleys will split apart
> Like wax before a fire,
> Like water dumped down a steep slope.
###### 5
> All this is because of Jacob’s rebellion
> And the sins of the nation of Israel.
> And just what is Jacob’s rebellion?
> Isn’t it Samaria’s doings?
> “And what is Judah’s sin?
> “Isn’t it Jerusalem’s doings?
###### 6
> “I will turn Samaria into a heap of ruins in an open field,
> “Into a place for planting vineyards.
> “I will dump the rubble of her walls down into the valley
> “And lay bare her foundations.
###### 7
> “All her carved idols will be smashed to pieces;
> “All her metal cult statues will be destroyed by fire.
> “I will make a waste heap of all her images.
> “Since she gathered the metal as a prostitute collects her wages,
> “The idols will become a prostitute’s wages again.”
###### ¶ 8
> For this reason I will mourn and wail;
> I will walk around barefoot and without my outer garments.
> I will howl like a wild dog,
> And screech like an owl.
###### 9
> For Samaria’s disease is incurable.
> It has infected Judah;
> It has spread to the leadership of my people
> And even to Jerusalem!
###### 10
> Don’t spread the news in Gath.
> “Don’t shed even a single tear.
> “In Beth Leaphrah roll about in mourning in the dust!
###### 11
> “Residents of Shaphir, pass by in nakedness and humiliation!
> “The residents of Zaanan have not escaped.
> “Beth Ezel mourns,
> “He takes from you what he desires.”
###### 12
> Indeed, the residents of Maroth hope for something good to happen,
> Though the LORD has sent disaster against the city of Jerusalem.
###### 13
> Residents of Lachish, hitch the horses to the chariots!
> You influenced Daughter Zion to sin,
> For Israel’s rebellious deeds can be traced back to you!
###### 14
> Therefore you will have to say farewell to Moresheth Gath.
> The residents of Achzib will be as disappointing
> As a dried up well to the kings of Israel.
###### 15
> Residents of Mareshah, a conqueror will attack you;
> The leaders of Israel shall flee to Adullam.
###### 16
> Shave your heads bald as you mourn for the children you love;
> Shave your foreheads as bald as an eagle,
> For they are taken from you into exile.
