# Psalm 63
###### ¶ 1
> O God, you are my God. I long for you.
> My soul thirsts for you,
> My flesh yearns for you,
> In a dry and parched land where there is no water.
###### 2
> Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you,
> And witnessed your power and splendor.
###### 3
> Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself,
> My lips will praise you.
###### 4
> For this reason I will praise you while I live;
> In your name I will lift up my hands.
###### 5
> As with choice meat you satisfy my soul.
> My mouth joyfully praises you,
###### ¶ 6
> Whenever I remember you on my bed,
> And think about you during the nighttime hours.
###### 7
> For you are my deliverer;
> Under your wings I rejoice.
###### 8
> My soul pursues you;
> Your right hand upholds me.
###### ¶ 9
> Enemies seek to destroy my life,
> But they will descend into the depths of the earth.
###### 10
> Each one will be handed over to the sword;
> Their corpses will be eaten by jackals.
###### 11
> But the king will rejoice in God;
> Everyone who takes oaths in his name will boast,
> For the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.
