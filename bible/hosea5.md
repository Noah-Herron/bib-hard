# Hosea 5
## Announcement of Sin and Judgment
###### ¶ 1
> Hear this, you priests!
> Pay attention, you Israelites!
> Listen closely, O king!
> For judgment is about to overtake you.
> For you were like a trap to Mizpah,
> Like a net spread out to catch Tabor.
###### 2
> Those who revolt are knee-deep in slaughter,
> But I will discipline them all.
###### 3
> I know Ephraim all too well;
> The evil of Israel is not hidden from me.
> For you have engaged in prostitution, O Ephraim;
> Israel has defiled itself.
###### 4
> Their wicked deeds do not allow them to return to their God;
> For a spirit of idolatry is in them,
> And they do not acknowledge the LORD.
###### 5
> The arrogance of Israel testifies against it;
> Israel and Ephraim will be overthrown because of their iniquity.
> Even Judah will be brought down with them.
## The Futility of Sacrificial Ritual without Moral Obedience
###### 6
> Although they bring their flocks and herds
> To seek the favor of the LORD,
> They will not find him—
> He has withdrawn himself from them!
###### 7
> They have committed treason against the LORD,
> Because they bore illegitimate children.
> Soon the new moon festival will devour them and their fields.
## The Prophet’s Declaration of Judgment
###### ¶ 8
> Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah!
> Sound the trumpet in Ramah!
> Sound the alarm in Beth Aven;
> Tremble in fear, O Benjamin!
###### 9
> Ephraim will be ruined in the day of judgment.
> What I am declaring to the tribes of Israel will certainly take place!
## The Oppressors of the Helpless Will Be Oppressed
###### 10
> The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary markers.
> I will pour out my rage on them like a torrential flood.
###### 11
> Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed under judgment,
> Because he was determined to pursue worthless idols.
## The Curse of the Incurable Wound
###### 12
> I will be like a moth to Ephraim,
> Like wood rot to the house of Judah.
###### 13
> When Ephraim saw his sickness
> And Judah saw his wound,
> Then Ephraim turned to Assyria,
> And begged its great king for help.
> But he will not be able to heal you.
> He cannot cure your wound!
## The Lion Will Carry Israel Off Into Exile
###### 14
> I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
> Like a young lion to the house of Judah.
> I myself will tear them to pieces,
> Then I will carry them off, and no one will be able to rescue them!
###### 15
> Then I will return again to my lair
> Until they have suffered their punishment.
> Then they will seek me;
> In their distress they will earnestly seek me.
