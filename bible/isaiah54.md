###### ¶ 1
> “Shout for joy, O barren one who has not given birth!
> “Give a joyful shout and cry out, you who have not been in labor!
> “For the children of the desolate one are more numerous
> “Than the children of the married woman,” says the LORD.
###### 2
> Make your tent larger,
> Stretch your tent curtains farther out!
> Spare no effort,
> Lengthen your ropes,
> And pound your stakes deep.
###### 3
> For you will spread out to the right and to the left;
> Your children will conquer nations
> And will resettle desolate cities.
###### ¶ 4
> Don’t be afraid, for you will not be put to shame.
> “Don’t be intimidated, for you will not be humiliated.
> “You will forget about the shame you experienced in your youth;
> “You will no longer remember the disgrace of your abandonment.
###### 5
> “For your husband is the one who made you—
> “The LORD of Heaven’s Armies is his name.
> “He is your Protector, the Holy One of Israel.
> “He is called “God of the entire earth.”
###### 6
> “Indeed, the LORD will call you back
> “Like a wife who has been abandoned and suffers from depression,
> “Like a young wife when she has been rejected,” says your God.
###### 7
> “For a short time I abandoned you,
> “But with great compassion I will gather you.
###### 8
> “In a burst of anger I rejected you momentarily,
> “But with lasting devotion I will have compassion on you,”
> Says your Protector, the LORD.
###### ¶ 9
> “As far as I am concerned, this is like in Noah’s time,
> “When I vowed that the waters of Noah’s flood would never again cover the earth.
> “In the same way I have vowed that I will not be angry at you or shout at you.
###### 10
> “Even if the mountains are removed
> “And the hills displaced,
> “My devotion will not be removed from you,
> “Nor will my covenant of friendship be displaced,”
> Says the LORD, the one who has compassion on you.
###### ¶ 11
> “O afflicted one, driven away, and unconsoled!
> “Look, I am about to set your stones in antimony,
> “And lay your foundation with lapis lazuli.
###### 12
> “I will make your pinnacles out of gems,
> “Your gates out of beryl,
> “And your outer wall out of beautiful stones.
###### 13
> “All your children will be followers of the LORD,
> “And your children will enjoy great prosperity.
###### 14
> “You will be reestablished when I vindicate you.
> “You will not experience oppression;
> “Indeed, you will not be afraid.
> “You will not be terrified,
> “For nothing frightening will come near you.
###### 15
> “If anyone dares to challenge you, it will not be my doing!
> “Whoever tries to challenge you will be defeated.
###### 16
> “Look, I create the craftsman,
> “Who fans the coals into a fire
> “And forges a weapon.
> “I create the destroyer so he might devastate.
###### 17
> “No weapon forged to be used against you will succeed;
> “You will refute everyone who tries to accuse you.
> “This is what the LORD will do for his servants—
> “I will vindicate them,”
> Says the LORD.
