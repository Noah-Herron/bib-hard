# Job 7
## The Brevity of Life
###### ¶ 1
> “Does not humanity have hard service on earth?
> “Are not their days also like the days of a hired man?
###### 2
> “Like a servant longing for the evening shadow,
> “And like a hired man looking for his wages,
###### 3
> “Thus I have been made to inherit
> “Months of futility,
> “And nights of sorrow
> “Have been appointed to me.
###### 4
> “If I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise?’
> “And the night stretches on
> “And I toss and turn restlessly
> “Until the day dawns.
###### 5
> “My body is clothed with worms and dirty scabs;
> “My skin is broken and festering.
###### 6
> “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle
> “And they come to an end without hope.
###### ¶ 7
> “Remember that my life is but a breath,
> “That my eyes will never again see happiness.
###### 8
> “The eye of him who sees me now will see me no more;
> “Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.
###### 9
> “As a cloud is dispersed and then disappears,
> “So the one who goes down to the grave
> “Does not come up again.
###### 10
> “He returns no more to his house,
> “Nor does his place of residence know him anymore.”
## Job Remonstrates with God
###### ¶ 11
> “Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth;
> “I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
> “I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
###### 12
> “Am I the sea, or the creature of the deep,
> “That you must put me under guard?
###### 13
> “If I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
> ‘My couch will ease my complaint,’
###### 14
> “Then you scare me with dreams
> “And terrify me with visions,
###### 15
> “So that I would prefer strangling,
> “And death more than life.
###### 16
> “I loathe it; I do not want to live forever;
> “Leave me alone, for my days are a vapor!”
## Insignificance of Humans
###### 17
> “What is mankind that you make so much of them,
> “And that you pay attention to them?
###### 18
> “And that you visit them every morning,
> “And try them every moment?
###### 19
> “Will you never look away from me,
> “Will you not let me alone
> “Long enough to swallow my spittle?
###### 20
> “If I have sinned—what have I done to you,
> “O watcher of men?
> “Why have you set me as your target?
> “Have I become a burden to you?
###### 21
> “And why do you not pardon my transgression,
> “And take away my iniquity?
> “For now I will lie down in the dust,
> “And you will seek me diligently,
> “But I will be gone.”
