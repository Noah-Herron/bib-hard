# Psalm 114
###### ¶ 1
> When Israel left Egypt,
> When the family of Jacob left a foreign nation behind,
###### 2
> Judah became his sanctuary,
> Israel his kingdom.
###### ¶ 3
> The sea looked and fled;
> The Jordan River turned back.
###### 4
> The mountains skipped like rams,
> The hills like lambs.
###### 5
> Why do you flee, O sea?
> Why do you turn back, O Jordan River?
###### 6
> Why do you skip like rams, O mountains,
> Like lambs, O hills?
###### ¶ 7
> Tremble, O earth, before the Lord—
> Before the God of Jacob,
###### 8
> Who turned a rock into a pool of water,
> A hard rock into springs of water.
