# Isaiah 38
## The Lord Hears Hezekiah’s Prayer
###### ¶ 1
In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz visited him and told him, “This is what the LORD says, ‘Give instructions to your household, for you are about to die; you will not get well.’”
###### 2
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
###### 3
“Please, LORD. Remember how I have served you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion, and how I have carried out your will.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.
###### ¶ 4
The Lord’s message came to Isaiah,
###### 5
“Go and tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: “I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I will add fifteen years to your life.
###### 6
‘I will also rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will shield this city.”’”
###### ¶ 7
Isaiah replied, “This is your sign from the LORD confirming that the LORD will do what he has said:
###### 8
“Look, I will make the shadow go back ten steps on the stairs of Ahaz.” And then the shadow went back ten steps.
## Hezekiah’s Song of Thanks
###### ¶ 9
This is the prayer of King Hezekiah of Judah when he was sick and then recovered from his illness:
###### 10
> “I thought,
> ‘In the middle of my life I must walk through the gates of Sheol,
> ‘I am deprived of the rest of my years.’
###### 11
> “I thought,
> ‘I will no longer see the LORD in the land of the living,
> ‘I will no longer look on humankind with the inhabitants of the world.
###### 12
> ‘My dwelling place is removed and taken away from me
> ‘As a shepherd’s tent.
> ‘I rolled up my life like a weaver rolls cloth;
> ‘From the loom he cuts me off.
> ‘You turn day into night and end my life.
###### 13
> ‘I cry out until morning;
> ‘Like a lion he shatters all my bones;
> ‘You turn day into night and end my life.
###### 14
> ‘Like a swallow or a thrush I chirp,
> ‘I coo like a dove;
> ‘My eyes grow tired from looking up to the sky.
> ‘O Lord, I am oppressed;
> ‘Help me!
###### ¶ 15
> ‘What can I say?
> ‘He has decreed and acted.
> ‘I will walk slowly all my years because I am overcome with grief.
###### 16
> ‘O Lord, your decrees can give men life;
> ‘May years of life be restored to me.
> ‘Restore my health and preserve my life.’
###### ¶ 17
> “Look, the grief I experienced was for my benefit.
> “You delivered me from the Pit of oblivion.
> “For you removed all my sins from your sight.
###### 18
> “Indeed Sheol does not give you thanks;
> “Death does not praise you.
> “Those who descend into the Pit do not anticipate your faithfulness.
###### 19
> “The living person, the living person, he gives you thanks,
> “As I do today.
> “A father tells his sons about your faithfulness.
###### 20
> “The LORD is about to deliver me,
> “And we will celebrate with music
> “For the rest of our lives in the LORD’s temple.”
###### ¶ 21
> Isaiah ordered, “Let them take a fig cake and apply it to the ulcerated sore and he will get well.”
###### 22
> Hezekiah said, “What is the confirming sign that I will go up to the LORD’s temple?”
