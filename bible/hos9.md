# Hosea 9
## Fertility Cult Festivals Have Intoxicated Israel
###### ¶ 1
> O Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly like the nations,
> For you are unfaithful to your God.
> You love to receive a prostitute’s wages
> On all the floors where you thresh your grain.
###### 2
> Threshing floors and wine vats will not feed the people,
> And new wine only deceives them.
## Assyrian Exile Will Reverse the Egyptian Exodus
###### 3
> They will not remain in the LORD’s land.
> Ephraim will return to Egypt;
> They will eat ritually unclean food in Assyria.
###### 4
> They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD;
> They will not please him with their sacrifices.
> Their sacrifices will be like bread eaten while in mourning;
> All those who eat them will make themselves ritually unclean.
> For their bread will be only to satisfy their appetite;
> It will not come into the temple of the LORD.
###### 5
> So what will you do on the festival day,
> On the festival days of the LORD?
## No Escape for the Israelites This Time
###### 6
> Look! Even if they flee from the destruction,
> Egypt will take hold of them,
> And Memphis will bury them.
> The weeds will inherit the silver they treasure—
> Thorn bushes will occupy their homes.
###### ¶ 7
> The time of judgment is about to arrive!
> The time of retribution is imminent!
> Israel will be humbled!
## Israel Rejects Hosea’s Prophetic Exhortations
> The prophet is considered a fool—
> The inspired man is viewed as a madman—
> Because of the multitude of your sins
> And your intense animosity.
###### 8
> The prophet is a watchman over Ephraim on behalf of God,
> Yet traps are laid for him along all his paths;
> Animosity rages against him in the land of his God.
## The Best of Times, the Worst of Times
###### 9
> They have sunk deep into corruption
> As in the days of Gibeah.
> He will remember their wrongdoing.
> He will repay them for their sins.
###### ¶ 10
> When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness.
> I viewed your ancestors like an early fig on a fig tree in its first season.
> Then they came to Baal Peor and they dedicated themselves to shame—
> They became as detestable as what they loved.
## The Fertility Worshipers Will Become Infertile
###### 11
> Ephraim will be like a bird;
> What they value will fly away.
> They will not bear children—
> They will not enjoy pregnancy—
> They will not even conceive!
###### 12
> Even if they raise their children,
> I will take away every last one of them.
> Woe to them!
> For I will turn away from them.
###### 13
> Ephraim, as I have seen, has given their children for prey;
> Ephraim will bear his sons for slaughter.
###### 14
> Give them, O LORD—
> What will you give them?
> Give them wombs that miscarry,
> And breasts that cannot nurse!
###### ¶ 15
> Because of all their evil in Gilgal,
> I hate them there.
> On account of their evil deeds,
> I will drive them out of my land.
> I will no longer love them;
> All their rulers are rebels.
###### 16
> Ephraim will be struck down—
> Their root will be dried up;
> They will not yield any fruit.
> Even if they do bear children,
> I will kill their precious offspring.
###### 17
> My God will reject them,
> For they have not obeyed him;
> So they will be fugitives among the nations.
