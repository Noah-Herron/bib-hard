# Psalm 1
## Book 1 (Psalms 1-41)
###### ¶ 1
> How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked,
> Or stand in the pathway with sinners,
> Or sit in the assembly of scoffers.
###### 2
> Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the LORD’s commands;
> He meditates on his commands day and night.
###### 3
> He is like a tree planted by flowing streams;
> It yields its fruit at the proper time,
> And its leaves never fall off.
> He succeeds in everything he attempts.
###### ¶ 4
> Not so with the wicked!
> Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
###### 5
> For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment,
> Nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
###### 6
> Certainly the LORD guards the way of the godly,
> But the way of the wicked ends in destruction.
