# Proverbs 9
## The Consequences of Accepting Wisdom or Folly
###### ¶ 1
> Wisdom has built her house;
> She has carved out its seven pillars.
###### 2
> She has prepared her meat, she has mixed her wine;
> She also has arranged her table.
###### 3
> She has sent out her female servants;
> She calls out on the highest places of the city.
###### 4
> “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here.”
> To those who lack understanding, she has said,
###### 5
> “Come, eat some of my food,
> “And drink some of the wine I have mixed.
###### 6
> “Abandon your foolish ways so that you may live,
> “And proceed in the way of understanding.”
###### ¶ 7
> Whoever corrects a mocker is asking for insult;
> Whoever reproves a wicked person receives abuse.
###### 8
> Do not reprove a mocker or he will hate you;
> Reprove a wise person and he will love you.
###### 9
> Give instruction to a wise person, and he will become wiser still;
> Teach a righteous person and he will add to his learning.
###### 10
> The beginning of wisdom is to fear the LORD,
> And acknowledging the Holy One is understanding.
###### 11
> For because of me your days will be many,
> And years will be added to your life.
###### 12
> If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage,
> But if you have mocked, you alone must bear it.
###### ¶ 13
> The woman called Folly is brash,
> She is naive and does not know anything.
###### 14
> And she has sat down at the door of her house,
> On a seat at the highest point of the city,
###### 15
> Calling out to those who are passing by her in the way,
> Who go straight on their way.
###### 16
> “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here,”
> To those who lack understanding she has said,
###### 17
> “Stolen waters are sweet,
> “And food obtained in secret is pleasant!”
###### 18
> But they do not realize that the dead are there,
> That her guests are in the depths of the grave.
