# Proverbs 28
###### ¶ 1
> The wicked person fled, though no one was pursuing,
> But the righteous person can be as confident as a lion.
###### 2
> When a country is rebellious it has many princes,
> But by someone who is discerning and knowledgeable order is maintained.
###### 3
> A poor person who oppresses the weak
> Is like a driving rain without food.
###### 4
> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
> But those who keep the law contend with them.
###### 5
> Evil people do not understand justice,
> But those who seek the LORD understand it all.
###### 6
> A poor person who walks in his integrity is better
> Than one who is perverse in his ways even though he is rich.
###### 7
> The one who keeps the law is a discerning child,
> But a companion of gluttons brings shame to his parents.
###### 8
> The one who increases his wealth by increasing interest
> Gathers it for someone who is gracious to the needy.
###### 9
> The one who turns away his ear from hearing the law,
> Even his prayer is an abomination.
###### 10
> The one who leads the upright astray in an evil way
> Will himself fall into his own pit,
> But the blameless will inherit what is good.
###### 11
> A rich person is wise in his own opinion,
> But a discerning poor person can evaluate him properly.
###### 12
> When the righteous rejoice, great is the glory,
> But when the wicked rise to power, people are sought out.
###### 13
> The one who covers his transgressions will not prosper,
> But whoever confesses them and forsakes them will find mercy.
###### 14
> Blessed is the one who is always cautious,
> But whoever hardens his heart will fall into evil.
###### 15
> Like a roaring lion or a roving bear,
> So is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
###### 16
> The prince who is a great oppressor lacks wisdom,
> But the one who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.
###### 17
> The one who is tormented by the murder of another will flee to the pit;
> Let no one support him.
###### 18
> The one who walks blamelessly will be delivered,
> But whoever is perverse in his ways will fall at once.
###### 19
> The one who works his land will be satisfied with food,
> But whoever chases daydreams will have his fill of poverty.
###### 20
> A faithful person will have an abundance of blessings,
> But the one who hastens to gain riches will not go unpunished.
###### 21
> To show partiality is terrible,
> For a person will transgress over the smallest piece of bread.
###### 22
> The stingy person hastens after riches
> And does not know that poverty will overtake him.
###### 23
> The one who reproves another will in the end find more favor
> Than the one who flatters with the tongue.
###### 24
> The one who robs his father and mother and says, “There is no transgression,”
> Is a companion to the one who destroys.
###### 25
> The greedy person stirs up dissension,
> But the one who trusts in the LORD will prosper.
###### 26
> The one who trusts in his own heart is a fool,
> But the one who walks in wisdom will escape.
###### 27
> The one who gives to the poor will not lack,
> But whoever shuts his eyes to them will receive many curses.
###### 28
> When the wicked gain control, people hide themselves,
> But when they perish, the righteous increase.
