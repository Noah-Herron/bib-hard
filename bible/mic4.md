# Micah 4
## Better Days Ahead for Jerusalem
###### ¶ 1
> And in future days the LORD’s Temple Mount will be the most important mountain of all;
> It will be more prominent than other hills.
> People will stream to it.
###### 2
> Many nations will come, saying,
> “Come on! Let’s go up to the LORD’s mountain,
> “To the temple of Jacob’s God,
> “So he can teach us his ways
> “And we can live by his laws.”
> For instruction will proceed from Zion,
> The LORD’s message from Jerusalem.
###### 3
> He will arbitrate between many peoples
> And settle disputes between many distant nations.
> They will beat their swords into plowshares,
> And their spears into pruning hooks.
> Nations will not use weapons against other nations,
> And they will no longer train for war.
###### 4
> Each will sit under his own grapevine
> Or under his own fig tree without any fear.
> The LORD of Heaven’s Armies has decreed it.
###### 5
> Though all the nations follow their respective gods,
> We will follow the LORD our God forever.
## Restoration Will Follow Crisis
###### ¶ 6
> “In that day,” says the LORD, “I will gather the lame
> “And assemble the outcasts whom I injured.
###### 7
> I will transform the lame into the nucleus of a new nation,
> And those far off into a mighty nation.
> The LORD will reign over them on Mount Zion,
> From that day forward and forevermore.
###### 8
> As for you, watchtower for the flock,
> Fortress of Daughter Zion—
> Your former dominion will be restored,
> The sovereignty that belongs to Daughter Jerusalem.”
###### ¶ 9
> Jerusalem, why are you now shouting so loudly?
> Has your king disappeared?
> Has your wise leader been destroyed?
> Is this why pain grips you as if you were a woman in labor?
###### 10
> Twist and strain, Daughter Zion, as if you were in labor!
> For you will leave the city
> And live in the open field.
> You will go to Babylon,
> But there you will be rescued.
> There the LORD will deliver you
> From the power of your enemies.
###### 11
> Many nations have now assembled against you.
> They say, “Jerusalem must be desecrated,
> “So we can gloat over Zion!”
###### 12
> But they do not know what the LORD is planning;
> They do not understand his strategy.
> He has gathered them like stalks of grain to be threshed at the threshing floor.
###### 13
> “Get up and thresh, Daughter Zion!
> “For I will give you iron horns;
> “I will give you bronze hooves,
> “And you will crush many nations.”
> You will devote to the LORD the spoils you take from them
> And dedicate their wealth to the sovereign Ruler of the whole earth.
