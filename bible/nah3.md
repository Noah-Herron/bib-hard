# Nahum 3
## Reason for Judgment: Sins of Nineveh
###### ¶ 1
> Woe to the city guilty of bloodshed!
> She is full of lies;
> She is filled with plunder;
> She has hoarded her spoil!
## Portrayal of the Destruction of Nineveh
###### 2
> The chariot drivers will crack their whips;
> The chariot wheels will shake the ground.
> The chariot horses will gallop;
> The war chariots will bolt forward!
###### 3
> The charioteers will charge ahead;
> Their swords will flash
> And their spears will glimmer!
> There will be many people slain;
> There will be piles of the dead
> And countless casualties—
> So many that people will stumble over the corpses.
## Taunt against the Harlot City
###### 4
> Because you have acted like a wanton prostitute—
> A seductive mistress who practices sorcery,
> Who enslaves nations by her harlotry,
> And entices peoples by her sorcery—
###### 5
> “I am against you,” declares the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.
> “I will strip off your clothes!
> “I will show your nakedness to the nations
> “And your shame to the kingdoms.
###### 6
> “I will pelt you with filth;
> “I will treat you with contempt;
> “I will make you a public spectacle.
###### 7
> “Everyone who sees you will turn away from you in disgust;
> “They will say, ‘Nineveh has been devastated!
> ‘Who will lament for her?’
> “There will be no one to comfort you!”
## Nineveh Will Suffer the Same Fate as Thebes
###### ¶ 8
> You are no more secure than Thebes—
> She was located on the banks of the Nile;
> The waters surrounded her—
> Her rampart was the sea,
> The water was her wall.
###### 9
> Cush and Egypt had limitless strength;
> Put and the Libyans were among her allies.
###### 10
> Yet she went into captivity as an exile;
> Even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street.
> They cast lots for her nobility;
> All her dignitaries were bound with chains.
###### 11
> You too will act like drunkards;
> You will go into hiding;
> You too will seek refuge from the enemy.
## The Assyrian Defenses Will Fail
###### 12
> All your fortifications will be like fig trees with first-ripe fruit:
> If they are shaken, their figs will fall into the mouth of the eater.
###### 13
> Your warriors will be like women in your midst;
> The gates of your land will be wide open to your enemies;
> Fire will consume the bars of your gates.
###### 14
> Draw yourselves water for a siege!
> Strengthen your fortifications!
> Trample the mud and tread the clay!
> Make mud bricks to strengthen your walls!
###### 15
> There the fire will consume you;
> The sword will cut you down;
> It will devour you like the young locust would.
## The Assyrian Defenders Will Flee
> Multiply yourself like the young locust;
> Multiply yourself like the flying locust!
###### 16
> Increase your merchants more than the stars of heaven!
> They are like the young locust that sheds its skin and flies away.
###### 17
> Your courtiers are like locusts,
> Your officials are like a swarm of locusts!
> They encamp in the walls on a cold day,
> Yet when the sun rises, they fly away,
> And no one knows where they are.
## Concluding Dirge
###### 18
> Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria.
> Your officers are slumbering!
> Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains,
> And there is no one to regather them.
###### 19
> Your destruction is like an incurable wound;
> Your demise is like a fatal injury.
> All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy,
> For no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!
