# Lamentations 1
## The Prophet Speaks
###### ¶ 1
> Alas! The city once full of people
> Now sits all alone!
> The prominent lady among the nations
> Has become a widow!
> The princess who once ruled the provinces
> Has become a forced laborer!
###### 2
> She weeps bitterly at night;
> Tears stream down her cheeks.
> She has no one to comfort her
> Among all her lovers.
> All her friends have betrayed her;
> They have become her enemies.
###### 3
> Judah has departed into exile
> Under affliction and harsh oppression.
> She lives among the nations;
> She has found no resting place.
> All who pursued her overtook her
> In narrow straits.
###### 4
> The roads to Zion mourn
> Because no one travels to the festivals.
> All her city gates are deserted;
> Her priests groan.
> Her virgins grieve;
> She is in bitter anguish!
###### 5
> Her foes subjugated her;
> Her enemies are at ease.
> For the LORD afflicted her
> Because of her many acts of rebellion.
> Her children went away
> Captive before the enemy.
###### 6
> All of Daughter Zion’s splendor
> Has departed.
> Her leaders became like deer;
> They found no pasture,
> So they were too exhausted to escape
> From the hunter.
###### 7
> Jerusalem remembers,
> When she became a poor homeless person,
> All her treasures
> That she owned in days of old.
> When her people fell into an enemy’s grip,
> None of her allies came to her rescue.
> Her enemies gloated over her;
> They sneered at her downfall.
###### 8
> Jerusalem committed terrible sin;
> Therefore she became an object of scorn.
> All who admired her have despised her
> Because they have seen her nakedness.
> She groans aloud
> And turns away in shame.
###### 9
> Her menstrual flow has soiled her clothing;
> She did not consider the consequences of her sin.
> Her demise was astonishing,
> And there was no one to comfort her.
> She cried, “Look, O LORD, on my affliction
> “Because my enemy boasts!”
###### 10
> An enemy grabbed
> All her valuables.
> Indeed she watched in horror as Gentiles
> Invaded her holy temple—
> Those whom you had commanded:
> “They must not enter your assembly place.”
###### 11
> All her people groaned
> As they searched for a morsel of bread.
> They exchanged their valuables
> For just enough food
> To stay alive.
## Jerusalem Speaks
> “Look, O LORD! Consider
> “That I have become worthless!”
###### 12
> Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by on the road?
> Look and see!
> Is there any pain like mine?
> The Lord has afflicted me,
> He has inflicted it on me
> When he burned with anger.
###### 13
> He sent down fire
> Into my bones, and it overcame them.
> He spread out a trapper’s net for my feet;
> He made me turn back.
> He has made me desolate;
> I am faint all day long.
###### 14
> My sins are bound around my neck like a yoke;
> They are fastened together by his hand.
> He has placed his yoke on my neck;
> He has sapped my strength.
> The Lord has handed me over
> To those whom I cannot resist.
###### 15
> He rounded up all my mighty ones;
> The Lord did this in my midst.
> He summoned an assembly against me
> To shatter my young men.
> The Lord has stomped like grapes
> The virgin daughter, Judah.
###### 16
> I weep because of these things;
> My eyes flow with tears.
> For there is no one in sight who can comfort me
> Or encourage me.
> My children are desolated
> Because an enemy has prevailed.
## The Prophet Speaks
###### 17
> Zion spread out her hands,
> But there is no one to comfort her.
> The LORD has issued a decree against Jacob;
> His neighbors have become his enemies.
> Jerusalem has become
> Like filthy garbage in their midst.
## Jerusalem Speaks
###### 18
> The LORD is right to judge me!
> Yes, I rebelled against his commands.
> Please listen, all you nations,
> And look at my suffering!
> My young women and men
> Have gone into exile.
###### 19
> I called for my lovers,
> But they had deceived me.
> My priests and my elders
> Perished in the city.
> Truly they had searched for food
> To keep themselves alive.
###### 20
> Look, O LORD! I am distressed;
> My stomach is in knots!
> My heart is pounding inside me.
> Yes, I was terribly rebellious!
> Out in the street the sword bereaves a mother of her children;
> Inside the house death is present.
###### 21
> They have heard that I groan,
> Yet there is no one to comfort me.
> All my enemies have heard of my trouble;
> They are glad that you have brought it about.
> Bring about the day of judgment that you promised
> So that they may end up like me!
###### 22
> Let all their wickedness come before you;
> Afflict them
> Just as you have afflicted me
> Because of all my acts of rebellion.
> For my groans are many,
> And my heart is sick with sorrow.
