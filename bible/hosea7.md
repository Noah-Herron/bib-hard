# Hosea 7
###### ¶ 1
> Whenever I want to heal Israel,
> The sin of Ephraim is revealed,
> And the evil deeds of Samaria are exposed.
> For they do what is wrong;
> Thieves break into houses,
> And gangs rob people out in the streets.
###### 2
> They do not realize
> That I remember all their wicked deeds.
> Their evil deeds have now surrounded them;
> Their sinful deeds are always before me.
## Political Intrigue and Conspiracy in the Palace
###### 3
> The royal advisers delight the king with their evil schemes,
> The princes make him glad with their lies.
###### 4
> They are all like bakers,
> They are like a smoldering oven;
> They are like a baker who does not stoke the fire
> Until the kneaded dough is ready for baking.
###### 5
> At the celebration of their king,
> His princes become inflamed with wine;
> They conspire with evildoers.
###### 6
> They approach him, all the while plotting against him.
> Their hearts are like an oven;
> Their anger smolders all night long,
> But in the morning it bursts into a flaming fire.
###### 7
> All of them are blazing like an oven;
> They devour their rulers.
> All their kings fall,
> And none of them call on me!
## Israel Lacks Discernment and Refuses to Repent
###### ¶ 8
> Ephraim has mixed itself like flour among the nations;
> Ephraim is like a ruined cake of bread that is scorched on one side.
###### 9
> Foreigners are consuming what his strenuous labor produced,
> But he does not recognize it.
> His head is filled with gray hair,
> But he does not realize it.
###### 10
> The arrogance of Israel testifies against him,
> Yet they refuse to return to the LORD their God.
> In spite of all this they refuse to seek him.
## Israel Turns to Assyria and Egypt for Help
###### 11
> Ephraim has been like a dove,
> Easily deceived and lacking discernment.
> They called to Egypt for help;
> They turned to Assyria for protection.
###### 12
> I will throw my bird net over them while they are flying;
> I will bring them down like birds in the sky;
> I will discipline them when I hear them flocking together.
## Israel Has Turned Away from the Lord
###### 13
> Woe to them! For they have fled from me!
> Destruction to them! For they have rebelled against me!
> I want to deliver them,
> But they have lied to me.
###### 14
> They do not pray to me,
> But howl in distress on their beds;
> They slash themselves for grain and new wine,
> But turn away from me.
###### 15
> Although I trained and strengthened them,
> They plot evil against me!
###### 16
> They turn to Baal;
> They are like an unreliable bow.
> Their leaders will fall by the sword
> Because their prayers to Baal have made me angry.
> So people will disdain them in the land of Egypt.
