# Proverbs 18
###### ¶ 1
> One who has isolated himself seeks his own desires;
> He rejects all sound judgment.
###### 2
> A fool takes no pleasure in understanding
> But only in disclosing what is on his mind.
###### 3
> When a wicked person arrives, contempt shows up with him,
> And with shame comes a reproach.
###### 4
> The words of a person’s mouth are like deep waters,
> And the fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.
###### 5
> It is terrible to show partiality to the wicked,
> By depriving a righteous man of justice.
###### 6
> The lips of a fool enter into strife,
> And his mouth invites a flogging.
###### 7
> The mouth of a fool is his ruin,
> And his lips are a snare for his life.
###### 8
> The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;
> And they have gone down into the person’s innermost being.
###### 9
> The one who is slack in his work
> Is a brother to one who destroys.
###### 10
> The name of the LORD is like a strong tower;
> The righteous person runs to it and is set safely on high.
###### 11
> The wealth of a rich person is like a strong city,
> And it is like a high wall in his imagination.
###### 12
> Before destruction the heart of a person is proud,
> But humility comes before honor.
###### 13
> The one who gives an answer before he listens—
> That is his folly and his shame.
###### 14
> A person’s spirit sustains him through sickness—
> But who can bear a crushed spirit?
###### 15
> The discerning person acquires knowledge,
> And the wise person seeks knowledge.
###### 16
> A person’s gift makes room for him,
> And leads him before important people.
###### 17
> The first to state his case seems right,
> Until his opponent begins to cross-examine him.
###### 18
> A toss of a coin ends disputes,
> And settles the issue between strong opponents.
###### 19
> A relative offended is harder to reach than a strong city,
> And disputes are like the barred gates of a fortified citadel.
###### 20
> From the fruit of a person’s mouth his stomach will be satisfied,
> With the product of his lips he will be satisfied.
###### 21
> Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
> And those who love its use will eat its fruit.
###### 22
> The one who has found a good wife has found what goodness is,
> And obtained a delightful gift from the LORD.
###### 23
> A poor person makes supplications,
> But a rich man answers harshly.
###### 24
> There are companions who harm one another,
> But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
