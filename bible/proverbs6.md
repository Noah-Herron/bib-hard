# Proverbs 6
## Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts
###### ¶ 1
> My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor,
> If you have become a guarantor for a stranger,
###### 2
> If you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered,
> And have been caught by the words you have spoken,
###### 3
> Then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,
> Because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:
> Go, humble yourself,
> And appeal firmly to your neighbor.
###### 4
> Permit no sleep to your eyes
> Or slumber to your eyelids.
###### 5
> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare,
> And like a bird from the trap of the fowler.
###### ¶ 6
> Go to the ant, you sluggard;
> Observe her ways and be wise!
###### 7
> It has no commander,
> Overseer, or ruler,
###### 8
> Yet it would prepare its food in the summer;
> It gathered at the harvest what it will eat.
###### 9
> How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?
> When will you rise from your sleep?
###### 10
> A little sleep, a little slumber,
> A little folding of the hands to relax,
###### 11
> And your poverty will come like a robber,
> And your need like an armed man.
###### ¶ 12
> A worthless and wicked person
> Walks around saying perverse things;
###### 13
> He winks with his eyes,
> Signals with his feet,
> And points with his fingers;
###### 14
> He plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,
> He spreads contention at all times.
###### 15
> Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;
> In an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
###### ¶ 16
> There are six things that the LORD hates,
> Even seven things that are an abomination to him:
###### 17
> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
> And hands that shed innocent blood,
###### 18
> A heart that devises wicked plans,
> Feet that are swift to run to evil,
###### 19
> A false witness who pours out lies,
> And a person who spreads discord among family members.
###### ¶ 20
> My child, guard the commands of your father
> And do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
###### 21
> Bind them on your heart continually;
> Fasten them around your neck.
###### 22
> When you walk about, they will guide you;
> When you lie down, they will watch over you;
> When you wake up, they will talk to you.
###### 23
> For the commandments are like a lamp,
> Instruction is like a light,
> And rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,
###### 24
> By keeping you from the evil woman,
> From the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
###### 25
> Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,
> And do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
###### 26
> For on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,
> But the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
###### 27
> Can a man hold fire against his chest
> Without burning his clothes?
###### 28
> Can a man walk on hot coals
> Without scorching his feet?
###### 29
> So it is with the one who sleeps with his neighbor’s wife;
> No one who touches her will escape punishment.
###### 30
> People do not despise a thief when he steals
> To fulfill his need when he is hungry.
###### 31
> Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,
> He might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
###### 32
> A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense,
> Whoever does it destroys his own life.
###### 33
> He will be beaten and despised,
> And his reproach will not be wiped away;
###### 34
> For jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,
> And he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
###### 35
> He will not consider any compensation;
> He will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.
