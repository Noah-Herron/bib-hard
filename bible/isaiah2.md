###### ¶ 2
> In future days
> The mountain of the LORD’s temple will endure
> As the most important of mountains,
> And will be the most prominent of hills.
> All the nations will stream to it;
###### 3
> Many peoples will come and say,
> “Come, let us go up to the LORD’s mountain,
> “To the temple of the God of Jacob,
> “So he can teach us his requirements,
> “And we can follow his standards.”
> For Zion will be the center for moral instruction;
> The LORD’s message will issue from Jerusalem.
###### 4
> He will judge disputes between nations;
> He will settle cases for many peoples.
> They will beat their swords into plowshares,
> And their spears into pruning hooks.
> Nations will not take up the sword against other nations,
> And they will no longer train for war.
###### ¶ 5
> O descendants of Jacob,
> Come, let us walk in the LORD’s guiding light.
## The Lord’s Day of Judgment
###### 6
> Indeed, O LORD, you have abandoned your people,
> The descendants of Jacob.
> For diviners from the east are everywhere;
> They consult omen readers like the Philistines do.
> Plenty of foreigners are around.
###### 7
> Their land is full of gold and silver;
> There is no end to their wealth.
> Their land is full of horses;
> There is no end to their chariots.
###### 8
> Their land is full of worthless idols;
> They worship the product of their own hands,
> What their own fingers have fashioned.
###### 9
> Men bow down to them in homage,
> They lie flat on the ground in worship.
> Don’t spare them!
###### 10
> “Go up into the rocky cliffs,
> “Hide in the ground.
> “Get away from the dreadful judgment of the LORD,
> “From his royal splendor!
###### 11
> “Proud men will be brought low,
> “Arrogant men will be humiliated;
> “The LORD alone will be exalted
> “In that day.
###### ¶ 12
> “Indeed, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies has planned a day of judgment,
> “For all the high and mighty,
> “For all who are proud—they will be humiliated;
###### 13
> “For all the cedars of Lebanon,
> “That are so high and mighty,
> “For all the oaks of Bashan;
###### 14
> “For all the tall mountains,
> “For all the high hills,
###### 15
> “For every high tower,
> “For every fortified wall,
###### 16
> “For all the large ships,
> “For all the impressive ships.
###### 17
> “Proud men will be humiliated,
> “Arrogant men will be brought low;
> “The LORD alone will be exalted
> “In that day.
###### 18
> “The worthless idols will be completely eliminated.
###### 19
> “They will go into caves in the rocky cliffs
> “And into holes in the ground,
> “Trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the LORD
> “And his royal splendor,
> “When he rises up to terrify the earth.
###### 20
> “At that time men will throw
> “Their silver and gold idols,
> “Which they made for themselves to worship,
> “Into the caves where rodents and bats live,
###### 21
> “So they themselves can go into the crevices of the rocky cliffs
> “And the openings under the rocky overhangs,
> “Trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the LORD
> “And his royal splendor,
> “When he rises up to terrify the earth.
###### 22
> “Stop trusting in human beings,
> “Whose life’s breath is in their nostrils.
> “For why should they be given special consideration?
