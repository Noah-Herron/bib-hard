# Isaiah 47
## Babylon Will Fall
###### ¶ 1
> “Fall down! Sit in the dirt,
> “O virgin daughter Babylon!
> “Sit on the ground, not on a throne,
> “O daughter of the Babylonians!
> “Indeed, you will no longer be called delicate and pampered.
###### 2
> “Pick up millstones and grind flour.
> “Remove your veil,
> “Strip off your skirt,
> “Expose your legs,
> “Cross the streams.
###### 3
> “Let your naked body be exposed.
> “Your shame will be on display!
> “I will get revenge;
> “I will not have pity on anyone,”
###### 4
> Says our Protector—
> The LORD of Heaven’s Armies is his name,
> The Holy One of Israel.
###### 5
> “Sit silently! Go to a hiding place,
> “O daughter of the Babylonians!
> “Indeed, you will no longer be called ‘Queen of kingdoms.’
###### 6
> “I was angry at my people;
> “I defiled my special possession
> “And handed them over to you.
> “You showed them no mercy;
> “You even placed a very heavy burden on old people.
###### 7
> “You said,
> ‘I will rule forever as permanent queen!’
> “You did not think about these things;
> “You did not consider how it would turn out.
###### ¶ 8
> “So now, listen to this,
> “O one who lives so lavishly,
> “Who lives securely,
> “Who says to herself,
> ‘I am unique! No one can compare to me!
> ‘I will never have to live as a widow;
> ‘I will never lose my children.’
###### 9
> “Both of these will come upon you
> “Suddenly, in one day!
> “You will lose your children and be widowed.
> “You will be overwhelmed by these tragedies,
> “Despite your many incantations
> “And your numerous amulets.
###### 10
> “You were complacent in your evil deeds;
> “You thought, ‘No one sees me.’
> “Your self-professed wisdom and knowledge lead you astray,
> “When you say, ‘I am unique! No one can compare to me!’
###### 11
> “Disaster will overtake you;
> “You will not know how to charm it away.
> “Destruction will fall on you;
> “You will not be able to appease it.
> “Calamity will strike you suddenly,
> “Before you recognize it.
###### ¶ 12
> “Persist in trusting your amulets
> “And your many incantations,
> “Which you have faithfully recited since your youth!
> “Maybe you will be successful—
> “Maybe you will scare away disaster.
###### 13
> “You are tired out from listening to so much advice.
> “Let them take their stand—
> “The ones who see omens in the sky,
> “Who gaze at the stars,
> “Who make monthly predictions—
> “Let them rescue you from the disaster that is about to overtake you!
###### 14
> “Look, they are like straw,
> “That the fire burns up;
> “They cannot rescue themselves
> “From the heat of the flames.
> “There are no coals to warm them,
> “No firelight to enjoy.
###### 15
> “They will disappoint you,
> “Those you have so faithfully dealt with since your youth.
> “Each strays off in his own direction,
> “Leaving no one to rescue you.”
