# Joel 2
## The Locusts’ Devastation
###### ¶ 1
> Blow the trumpet in Zion;
> Sound the alarm signal on my holy mountain!
> Let all the inhabitants of the land shake with fear,
> For the day of the LORD is about to come.
> Indeed, it is near!
###### 2
> It will be a day of dreadful darkness,
> A day of foreboding storm clouds,
> Like blackness spread over the mountains.
> It is a huge and powerful army—
> There has never been anything like it ever before,
> And there will not be anything like it for many generations to come!
###### 3
> Like fire they devour everything in their path;
> A flame blazes behind them.
> The land looks like the Garden of Eden before them,
> But behind them there is only a desolate wilderness—
> For nothing escapes them!
###### 4
> They look like horses;
> They charge ahead like war horses.
###### 5
> They sound like chariots rumbling over mountain tops,
> Like the crackling of blazing fire consuming stubble,
> Like the noise of a mighty army being drawn up for battle.
###### 6
> People writhe in fear when they see them.
> All their faces turn pale with fright.
###### 7
> They charge like warriors;
> They scale walls like soldiers.
> Each one proceeds on his course;
> They do not alter their path.
###### 8
> They do not jostle one another;
> Each of them marches straight ahead.
> They burst through the city defenses
> And do not break ranks.
###### 9
> They rush into the city;
> They scale its walls.
> They climb up into the houses;
> They go in through the windows like a thief.
###### 10
> The earth quakes before them;
> The sky reverberates.
> The sun and the moon grow dark;
> The stars refuse to shine.
###### 11
> The voice of the LORD thunders as he leads his army.
> Indeed, his warriors are innumerable;
> Surely his command is carried out!
> Yes, the day of the LORD is awesome
> And very terrifying—who can survive it?
## An Appeal for Repentance
###### ¶ 12
> “Yet even now,” the LORD says,
> “Return to me with all your heart—
> “With fasting, weeping, and mourning.
###### 13
> “Tear your hearts,
> “Not just your garments.”
> Return to the LORD your God,
> For he is merciful and compassionate,
> Slow to anger and boundless in loyal love—often relenting from calamitous punishment.
###### 14
> Who knows?
> Perhaps he will be compassionate and grant a reprieve,
> And leave blessing in his wake—
> A meal offering and a drink offering for you to offer to the LORD your God!
###### 15
> Blow the trumpet in Zion.
> Announce a holy fast;
> Proclaim a sacred assembly.
###### 16
> Gather the people;
> Sanctify an assembly!
> Gather the elders;
> Gather the children and the nursing infants.
> Let the bridegroom come out from his bedroom
> And the bride from her private quarters.
###### 17
> Let the priests, those who serve the LORD, weep
> From the vestibule all the way back to the altar.
> Let them say, “Have pity, O LORD, on your people;
> “Please do not turn over your inheritance to be mocked,
> “To become a proverb among the nations.
> “Why should it be said among the peoples,
> ‘Where is their God?’
## The LORD’s Response
###### ¶ 18
> “Then the LORD became zealous for his land;
> “He had compassion on his people.
###### 19
> “The LORD responded to his people,
> “Look! I am about to restore your grain
> “As well as fresh wine and olive oil.
> “You will be fully satisfied.
> “I will never again make you an object of mockery among the nations.
###### 20
> “I will remove the one from the north far from you.
> “I will drive him out to a dry and desolate place.
> “Those in front will be driven eastward into the Dead Sea,
> “And those in back westward into the Mediterranean Sea.
> “His stench will rise up as a foul smell.”
> Indeed, the LORD has accomplished great things!
###### ¶ 21
> Do not fear, my land.
> Rejoice and be glad,
> Because the LORD has accomplished great things!
###### 22
> Do not fear, wild animals.
> For the pastures of the wilderness are again green with grass.
> Indeed, the trees bear their fruit;
> The fig tree and the vine yield to their fullest.
###### 23
> Citizens of Zion, rejoice!
> Be glad because of what the LORD your God has done!
> For he has given to you the early rains as vindication.
> He has sent to you the rains—
> Both the early and the late rains as formerly.
###### 24
> The threshing floors are full of grain;
> The vats overflow with fresh wine and olive oil.
###### 25
> I will make up for the years
> That the ‘arbeh-locust consumed your crops—
> ‘The yeleq-locust, the hasil-locust, and the gazam-locust—
> ‘My great army that I sent against you.
###### 26
> ‘You will have plenty to eat,
> ‘And your hunger will be fully satisfied;
> ‘You will praise the name of the LORD your God,
> ‘Who has acted wondrously in your behalf.
> ‘My people will never again be put to shame.
###### 27

> ‘I am the LORD your God; there is no other.
> ‘My people will never again be put to shame.
