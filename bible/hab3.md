# Habakkuk 3
## Habakkuk’s Vision of the Divine Warrior
###### ¶ 1
This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet:
###### ¶ 2
> LORD, I have heard the report of what you did;
> I am awed, LORD, by what you accomplished.
> In our time repeat those deeds;
> In our time reveal them again.
> But when you cause turmoil, remember to show us mercy!
###### ¶ 3
> God comes from Teman,
> The Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah.
> His splendor has covered the skies,
> The earth is full of his glory.
###### 4
> His brightness will be as lightning;
> A two-pronged lightning bolt flashing from his hand.
> This is the outward display of his power.
###### 5
> Plague will go before him;
> Pestilence will march right behind him.
###### 6
> He took his battle position and shook the earth;
> With a mere look he frightened the nations.
> The ancient mountains disintegrated;
> The primeval hills were flattened.
> His are ancient roads.
###### 7
> I saw the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble;
> The tent curtains of the land of Midian were shaking.
###### ¶ 8
> Was the LORD mad at the rivers?
> Were you angry with the rivers?
> Were you enraged at the sea?
> Such that you would climb into your horse-drawn chariots,
> Your victorious chariots?
###### 9
> Your bow is ready for action;
> You commission your arrows. Selah.
> You cause flash floods on the earth’s surface.
###### 10
> When the mountains see you, they shake.
> The torrential downpour sweeps through.
> The great deep shouts out;
> It lifts its hands high.
###### 11
> The sun and moon stand still in their courses;
> The flash of your arrows drives them away,
> The bright light of your lightning-quick spear.
###### 12
> You furiously stomp on the earth;
> You angrily trample down the nations.
###### 13
> You march out to deliver your people,
> To deliver your special servant.
> You strike the leader of the wicked nation,
> Laying him open from the lower body to the neck. Selah.
###### 14
> You pierce the heads of his warriors with a spear.
> They storm forward to scatter us;
> They shout with joy as if they were plundering the poor with no opposition.
###### 15
> But you trample on the sea with your horses,
> On the surging, raging waters.
## Habakkuk Declares His Confidence
###### ¶ 16
> I listened and my stomach churned;
> The sound made my lips quiver.
> My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying,
> And I shook as I tried to walk.
> I long for the day of distress
> To come upon the people who attack us.
###### 17
> When the fig tree does not bud,
> And there are no grapes on the vines;
> When the olive trees do not produce
> And the fields yield no crops;
> When the sheep disappear from the pen
> And there are no cattle in the stalls—
###### 18
> I will rejoice because of the LORD;
> I will be happy because of the God who delivers me!
###### 19
> The Sovereign LORD is my source of strength.
> He gives me the agility of a deer;
> He enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
(This prayer is for the song leader. It is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)
