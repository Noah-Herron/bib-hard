> A great king who is superior to all gods.
###### 4
> The depths of the earth are in his hand,
> And the mountain peaks belong to him.
###### 5

> His hands formed the dry land.
###### ¶ 6
> Come, let us bow down and worship.
> Let us kneel before the LORD, our Creator.

> Today, if only you would obey him.
###### 8
> He says, “Do not be stubborn like they were at Meribah,
> “Like they were that day at Massah in the wilderness,
###### 9
> “Where your ancestors challenged my authority,
> “And tried my patience, even though they had seen my work.
###### 10
> “For forty years I was continually disgusted with that generation,
> “And I said, ‘These people desire to go astray;
> ‘They do not obey my commands.’
###### 11
> “So I made a vow in my anger,
> ‘They will never enter into the resting place I had set aside for them.’”
