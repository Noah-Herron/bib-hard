# Psalm 7
###### ¶ 1
> O LORD my God, in you I have taken shelter.
> Deliver me from all who chase me. Rescue me!
###### 2
> Otherwise they will rip me to shreds like a lion;
> They will tear me to bits and no one will be able to rescue me.
###### ¶ 3
> O LORD my God, if I have done what they say,
> Or am guilty of unjust actions,
###### 4
> Or have wronged my ally,
> Or helped his lawless enemy,
###### 5
> May an enemy relentlessly chase me and catch me;
> May he trample me to death
> And leave me lying dishonored in the dust. (Selah)
###### ¶ 6
> Stand up angrily, LORD.
> Rise up with raging fury against my enemies.
> Wake up for my sake, and execute the judgment you have decreed for them.
###### 7
> The countries are assembled all around you;
> Take once more your rightful place over them.
###### 8
> The LORD judges the nations.
> Vindicate me, LORD, because I am innocent,
> Because I am blameless, O Exalted One.
###### 9
> May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end.
> But make the innocent secure,
> O righteous God,
> You who examine inner thoughts and motives.
###### 10
> The Exalted God is my shield,
> The one who delivers the morally upright.
###### 11
> God is a just judge;
> He is angry throughout the day.
###### ¶ 12
> If a person does not repent, God will wield his sword.
> He has prepared to shoot his bow.
###### 13
> He has prepared deadly weapons to use against him;
> He gets ready to shoot flaming arrows.
###### 14
> See the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
> Who conceives destructive plans,
> And gives birth to harmful lies—
###### 15
> He digs a pit
> And then falls into the hole he has made.
###### 16
> He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans—
> And the violence he intended for others falls on his own head.
###### ¶ 17
> I will thank the LORD for his justice;
> I will sing praises to the LORD Most High!
