# Ecclesiastes 7
## Life is Brief and Death is Certain
###### ¶ 1
> A good reputation is better than precious perfume;
> Likewise, the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.
###### 2
> It is better to go to a funeral
> Than a feast.
> For death is the destiny of every person,
> And the living should take this to heart.
###### 3
> Sorrow is better than laughter,
> Because sober reflection is good for the heart.
###### 4
> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
> But the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.
## Frivolous Living Versus Wisdom
###### 5
> It is better for a person to receive a rebuke from those who are wise
> Than to listen to the song of fools.
###### 6
> For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot,
> So is the laughter of the fool.
> This kind of folly also is useless.
## Human Wisdom Overturned by Adversity
###### 7
> Surely oppression can turn a wise person into a fool;
> Likewise, a bribe corrupts the heart.
###### 8
> The end of a matter is better than its beginning;
> Likewise, patience is better than pride.
###### 9
> Do not let yourself be quickly provoked,
> For anger resides in the lap of fools.
###### 10
> Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these days?”
> For it is not wise to ask that.
## Wisdom Can Lengthen One’s Life
###### 11
> Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing;
> It benefits those who see the light of day.
###### 12
> For wisdom provides protection,
> Just as money provides protection.
> But the advantage of knowledge is this:
> Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
## Wisdom Acknowledges God’s Orchestration of Life
###### 13
> Consider the work of God:
> For who can make straight what he has bent?
###### 14
> In times of prosperity be joyful,
> But in times of adversity consider this:
> God has made one as well as the other,
> So that no one can discover what the future holds.
## Exceptions to the Law of Retribution
###### ¶ 15
> During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things:
> Sometimes a righteous person dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness,
> And sometimes a wicked person lives long in spite of his evil deeds.
###### 16
> So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise;
> Otherwise you might be disappointed.
###### 17
> Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool;
> Otherwise you might die before your time.
###### 18
> It is best to take hold of one warning without letting go of the other warning;
> For the one who fears God will follow both warnings.
## Wisdom Needed Because No One is Truly Righteous
###### ¶ 19
> Wisdom gives a wise person more protection
> Than ten rulers in a city.
###### 20
> For there is not one truly righteous person on the earth
> Who continually does good and never sins.
###### 21
> Also, do not pay attention to everything that people say;
> Otherwise, you might even hear your servant cursing you.
###### 22
> For you know in your own heart
> That you also have cursed others many times.
## Human Wisdom is Limited
###### ¶ 23
> I have examined all this by wisdom;
> I said, “I am determined to comprehend this”—but it was beyond my grasp.
###### 24
> Whatever has happened is beyond human understanding;
> It is far deeper than anyone can fathom.
## True Righteousness and Wisdom Are Virtually Nonexistent
###### 25
> I tried to understand, examine, and comprehend
> The role of wisdom in the scheme of things,
> And to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the insanity of folly.
###### 26
> I discovered this:
> More bitter than death is the kind of woman who is like a hunter’s snare;
> Her heart is like a hunter’s net and her hands are like prison chains.
> The man who pleases God escapes her,
> But the sinner is captured by her.
###### ¶ 27
> The Teacher says:
> I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item.
###### 28
> What I have continually sought, I have not found;
> I have found only one upright man among a thousand,
> But I have not found one upright woman among all of them.
###### 29
> This alone have I discovered: God made humankind upright,
> But they have sought many evil schemes.
