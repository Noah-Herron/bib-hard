> You who go down to the sea, and everything that lives in it,
> You coastlands and those who live there.
###### 11
> Let the wilderness and its cities shout out,
> The towns where the nomads of Kedar live.
> Let the residents of Sela shout joyfully;
> Let them shout loudly from the mountaintops.
###### 12
> Let them give the LORD the honor he deserves;
> Let them praise his deeds in the coastlands.
###### 13

> Like a warrior he inspires himself for battle;
> He shouts, yes, he yells,
> He shows his enemies his power.
###### ¶ 14
> “I have been inactive for a long time;
> “I kept quiet and held back.
> “Like a woman in labor I groan;
> “I pant and gasp.
###### 15

> “I will dry up all their vegetation.
> “I will turn streams into islands,
> “And dry up pools of water.
###### 16
> “I will lead the blind along an unfamiliar way;
> “I will guide them down paths they have never traveled.
> “I will turn the darkness in front of them into light,
> “And level out the rough ground.
> “This is what I will do for them.
> “I will not abandon them.
###### 17
> “Those who trust in idols
> “Will turn back and be utterly humiliated,
> “Those who say to metal images, ‘You are our gods.’”
## The Lord Reasons with His People
###### ¶ 18
> “Listen, you deaf ones!
> “Take notice, you blind ones!
###### 19
> “My servant is truly blind,
> “My messenger is truly deaf.
> “My covenant partner, the servant of the LORD, is truly blind.
###### 20
> “You see many things, but don’t comprehend;
> “Their ears are open, but do not hear.”
###### 21
> The LORD wanted to exhibit his justice
> By magnifying his law and displaying it.
###### 22
> But these people are looted and plundered;
> All of them are trapped in pits
> And held captive in prisons.
> They were carried away as loot with no one to rescue them;
> They were carried away as plunder, and no one says, “Bring that back!”
###### ¶ 23
> Who among you will pay attention to this?
> Who will listen attentively in the future?
###### 24
> Who handed Jacob over to the robber?
> Who handed Israel over to the looters?
> Was it not the LORD, against whom we sinned?
> They refused to follow his commands;
> They disobeyed his law.
###### 25
> So he poured out his fierce anger on them,
> Along with the devastation of war.
> Its flames encircled them, but they did not realize it;
> It burned against them, but they did not take it to heart.
