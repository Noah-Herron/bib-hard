# Psalm 56
###### ¶ 1
> Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me.
> All day long hostile enemies are tormenting me.
###### 2
> Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long.
> Indeed, many are fighting against me, O Exalted One.
###### 3
> When I am afraid,
> I trust in you.
###### 4
> In God—I boast in his promise—
> In God I trust; I am not afraid.
> What can mere men do to me?
###### 5
> All day long they cause me trouble;
> They make a habit of plotting my demise.
###### 6
> They stalk and lurk;
> They watch my every step,
> As they prepare to take my life.
###### 7
> Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape.
> In your anger bring down the nations, O God.
###### ¶ 8
> You keep track of my misery.
> Put my tears in your leather container.
> Are they not recorded in your scroll?
###### 9
> My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help;
> I know that God is on my side.
###### 10
> In God—I boast in his promise—
> In the LORD—I boast in his promise—
###### 11
> In God I trust; I am not afraid.
> What can mere men do to me?
###### 12
> I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God;
> I will give you the thank offerings you deserve,
###### 13
> When you deliver my life from death.
> You keep my feet from stumbling,
> So that I might serve God as I enjoy life.
