# Ecclesiastes 6
## Not Everyone Enjoys Life
###### ¶ 1
> Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth,
> And it weighs heavily on people:
###### 2
> God gives a man riches, property, and wealth
> So that he lacks nothing that his heart desires,
> Yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor—
> Instead, someone else enjoys it!
> This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.
###### 3
> Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years,
> Even if he lives a long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity—
> Even if he were to live forever—
> I would say, “A stillborn child is better off than he is.”
###### 4
> Though the stillborn child came into the world for no reason and departed into darkness,
> Though its name is shrouded in darkness,
###### 5
> Though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything,
> Yet it has more rest than that man—
###### 6
> If he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity.
> For both of them die!
###### ¶ 7
> All man’s labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach—
> Yet his appetite is never satisfied!
###### 8
> So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool?
> And what advantage does a pauper gain by knowing how to survive?
###### 9
> It is better to be content with what the eyes can see
> Than for one’s heart always to crave more.
> This continual longing is futile—like chasing the wind.
## The Futile Way Life Works
###### ¶ 10
> Whatever has happened was foreordained,
> And what happens to a person was also foreknown.
> It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate
> Because God is more powerful than he is.
###### 11
> The more one argues with words, the less he accomplishes.
> How does that benefit him?
###### 12
> For no one knows what is best for a person during his life—
> During the few days of his fleeting life—
> For they pass away like a shadow.
> Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.
