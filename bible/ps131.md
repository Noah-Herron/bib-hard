# Psalm 131
###### Â¶ 1
> O LORD, my heart is not proud,
> Nor do I have a haughty look.
> I do not have great aspirations,
> Or concern myself with things that are beyond me.
###### 2
> Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself
> Like a weaned child with its mother;
> I am content like a young child.
###### 3
> O Israel, hope in the LORD
> Now and forevermore!
