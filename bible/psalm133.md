# Psalm 133
###### ¶ 1
> Look! How good and how pleasant it is
> When brothers truly live in unity.
###### 2
> It is like fine oil poured on the head,
> Which flows down the beard—
> Aaron’s beard,
> And then flows down his garments.
###### 3
> It is like the dew of Hermon,
> Which flows down upon the hills of Zion.
> Indeed, that is where the LORD has decreed
> A blessing will be available—eternal life.
