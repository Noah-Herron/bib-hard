# Isaiah 63
## The Victorious Divine Warrior
###### ¶ 1
> Who is this who comes from Edom,
> Dressed in bright red, coming from Bozrah?
> Who is this one wearing royal attire,
> Who marches confidently because of his great strength?
> “It is I, the one who announces vindication,
> “And who is able to deliver!”
###### 2
> Why are your clothes red?
> Why do you look like someone who has stomped on grapes in a vat?
###### 3
> “I have stomped grapes in the winepress all by myself;
> “No one from the nations joined me.
> “I stomped on them in my anger;
> “I trampled them down in my rage.
> “Their juice splashed on my garments,
> “And stained all my clothes.
###### 4
> “For I looked forward to the day of vengeance,
> “And then payback time arrived.
###### 5
> “I looked, but there was no one to help;
> “I was shocked because there was no one offering support.
> “So my right arm accomplished deliverance;
> “My raging anger drove me on.
###### 6
> “I trampled nations in my anger;
> “I made them drunk in my rage;
> “I splashed their blood on the ground.”
## A Prayer for Divine Intervention
###### ¶ 7
> I will tell of the faithful acts of the LORD,
> Of the LORD’s praiseworthy deeds.
> I will tell about all the LORD did for us,
> The many good things he did for the family of Israel,
> Because of his compassion and great faithfulness.
###### 8
> He said, “Certainly they will be my people,
> “Children who are not disloyal.”
> He became their deliverer.
###### 9
> Through all that they suffered, he suffered too.
> The messenger sent from his very presence delivered them.
> In his love and mercy he protected them;
> He lifted them up and carried them throughout ancient times.
###### 10
> But they rebelled and offended his holy Spirit,
> So he turned into an enemy
> And fought against them.
###### 11
> His people remembered the ancient times.
> Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea,
> Along with the shepherd of his flock?
> Where is the one who placed his holy Spirit among them,
###### 12
> The one who made his majestic power available to Moses,
> Who divided the water before them,
> Gaining for himself a lasting reputation,
###### 13
> Who led them through the deep water?
> Like a horse running through the wilderness they did not stumble.
###### 14
> As an animal that goes down into a valley to graze,
> So the Spirit of the LORD granted them rest.
> In this way you guided your people,
> Gaining for yourself an honored reputation.
###### ¶ 15
> Look down from heaven and take notice,
> From your holy, majestic palace!
> Where are your zeal and power?
> Do not hold back your tender compassion!
###### 16
> For you are our father,
> Though Abraham does not know us
> And Israel does not recognize us.
> You, LORD, are our father;
> You have been called our Protector from ancient times.
###### 17
> Why, LORD, do you make us stray from your ways,
> And make our minds stubborn so that we do not obey you?
> Return for the sake of your servants,
> The tribes of your inheritance!
###### 18
> For a short time your special nation possessed a land,
> But then our adversaries knocked down your holy sanctuary.
###### 19
> We existed from ancient times,
> But you did not rule over them;
> They were not your subjects.
