## God Takes Vengeance against His Enemies
###### ¶ 2
> The LORD is a zealous and avenging God;
> The LORD is avenging and very angry.
> The LORD takes vengeance against his foes;
> He sustains his rage against his enemies.
###### 3
> The LORD is slow to anger but great in power;
> The LORD will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.
## The Divine Warrior Destroys His Enemies but Protects His People
> He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm;
> Dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.
###### 4
> He shouts a battle cry against the sea and makes it dry up;
> He makes all the rivers run dry.
> Bashan and Carmel wither;
> The blossom of Lebanon withers.
###### 5
> The mountains tremble before him,
> The hills convulse;
> The earth is laid waste before him,
> The world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.
###### 6
> No one can withstand his indignation!
> No one can resist his fierce anger!
> His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire,
> Boulders are broken up as he approaches.
###### 7
> The LORD is good—
> Indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress,
> And he protects those who seek refuge in him.
###### 8
> But with an overwhelming flood
> He will make a complete end of Nineveh;
> He will drive his enemies into darkness.
## Denunciation and Destruction of Nineveh
###### ¶ 9
> Whatever you plot against the LORD, he will completely destroy!
> Distress will not arise a second time.
###### 10
> Surely they will be totally consumed
> Like entangled thorn bushes,
> Like the drink of drunkards,
> Like very dry stubble.
###### 11
> From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the LORD,
> A wicked military strategist.
## Oracle of Deliverance to Judah
###### 12
This is what the LORD says:
> “Even though they are powerful—
> “And what is more, even though their army is numerous—
> “Nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away!
> “Although I afflicted you,
> “I will afflict you no more.
###### 13
> “And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck;
> “I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”
## Oracle of Judgment against the King of Nineveh
###### ¶ 14
> The LORD has issued a decree against you:
> “Your dynasty will come to an end.
> “I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.
> “I will desecrate your grave, because you are accursed!”
## Proclamation of the Deliverance of Judah
###### ¶ 15
>  Look! A herald is running on the mountains!
> A messenger is proclaiming deliverance:
> “Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!
> “Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God!
> “For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you;
> “They have been completely destroyed.”
