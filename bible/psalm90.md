# Psalm 90
## Book 4 (Psalms 90-106)
###### ¶ 1
> O Lord, you have been our protector through all generations.
###### 2
> Even before the mountains came into existence,
> Or you brought the world into being,
> You were the eternal God.
###### ¶ 3
> You make mankind return to the dust,
> And say, “Return, O people.”
###### 4
> Yes, in your eyes a thousand years
> Are like yesterday that quickly passes,
> Or like one of the divisions of the nighttime.
###### 5
> You bring their lives to an end and they “fall asleep.”
> In the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up:
###### 6
> In the morning it glistens and sprouts up;
> At evening time it withers and dries up.
###### ¶ 7
> Yes, we are consumed by your anger;
> We are terrified by your wrath.
###### 8
> You are aware of our sins;
> You even know about our hidden sins.
###### 9
> Yes, throughout all our days we experience your raging fury;
> The years of our lives pass quickly, like a sigh.
###### 10
> The days of our lives add up to seventy years,
> Or eighty, if one is especially strong.
> But even one’s best years are marred by trouble and oppression.
> Yes, they pass quickly and we fly away.
###### 11
> Who can really fathom the intensity of your anger?
> Your raging fury causes people to fear you.
###### 12
> So teach us to consider our mortality,
> So that we might live wisely.
###### ¶ 13
> Turn back toward us, O LORD.
> How long must this suffering last?
> Have pity on your servants.
###### 14
> Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal love.
> Then we will shout for joy and be happy all our days.
###### 15
> Make us happy in proportion to the days you have afflicted us,
> In proportion to the years we have experienced trouble.
###### 16
> May your servants see your work.
> May their sons see your majesty.
###### 17
> May our Sovereign God extend his favor to us.
> Make our endeavors successful.
> Yes, make them successful.
