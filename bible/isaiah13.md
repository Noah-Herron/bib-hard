# Isaiah 13
## The Lord Will Judge Babylon
###### ¶ 1
> This is an oracle about Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
###### 2
> On a bare hill raise a signal flag;
> Shout to them,
> Wave your hand,
> So they might enter the gates of the princes!
###### 3
> I have given orders to my chosen soldiers;
> I have summoned the warriors through whom I will vent my anger—
> My boasting, arrogant ones.
###### 4
> There is a loud noise on the mountains—
> It sounds like a large army!
> There is great commotion among the kingdoms—
> Nations are being assembled!
> The LORD of Heaven’s Armies is mustering
> Forces for battle.
###### 5
> They come from a distant land,
> From the horizon.
> It is the LORD with his instruments of judgment,
> Coming to destroy the whole earth.
###### 6
> Wail, for the LORD’s day of judgment is near;
> It comes with all the destructive power of the Sovereign One.
###### 7
> For this reason all hands hang limp,
> Every human heart loses its courage.
###### 8
> They panic—
> Cramps and pain seize hold of them
> Like those of a woman who is straining to give birth.
> They look at one another in astonishment;
> Their faces are flushed red.
###### 9
> Look, the LORD’s day of judgment is coming;
> It is a day of cruelty and savage, raging anger,
> Destroying the earth
> And annihilating its sinners.
###### 10
> Indeed the stars in the sky and their constellations
> No longer give out their light;
> The sun is darkened as soon as it rises,
> And the moon does not shine.
###### 11
> I will punish the world for its evil,
> And wicked people for their sin.
> I will put an end to the pride of the insolent,
> I will bring down the arrogance of tyrants.
###### 12
> I will make human beings more scarce than pure gold,
> And people more scarce than gold from Ophir.
###### 13
> So I will shake the heavens,
> And the earth will shake loose from its foundation,
> Because of the fury of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> In the day he vents his raging anger.
###### 14
> Like a frightened gazelle
> Or a sheep with no shepherd,
> Each will turn toward home,
> Each will run to his homeland.
###### 15
> Everyone who is caught will be stabbed;
> Everyone who is seized will die by the sword.
###### 16
> Their children will be smashed to pieces before their very eyes;
> Their houses will be looted
> And their wives raped.
###### ¶ 17
> Look, I am stirring up the Medes to attack them;
> They are not concerned about silver,
> Nor are they interested in gold.
###### 18
> Their arrows will cut young men to ribbons;
> They have no compassion on a person’s offspring;
> They will not look with pity on children.
###### 19
> Babylon, the most admired of kingdoms,
> The Chaldeans’ source of honor and pride,
> Will be destroyed by God
> Just as Sodom and Gomorrah were.
###### 20
> No one will live there again;
> No one will ever reside there again.
> No bedouin will camp there,
> No shepherds will rest their flocks there.
###### 21
> Wild animals will rest there,
> The ruined houses will be full of hyenas.
> Ostriches will live there,
> Wild goats will skip among the ruins.
###### 22
> Wild dogs will yip in her ruined fortresses,
> Jackals will yelp in the once-splendid palaces.
> Her time is almost up,
> Her days will not be prolonged.
