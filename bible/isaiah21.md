# Isaiah 21
## The Lord Will Judge Babylon
###### ¶ 1
> This is an oracle about the wilderness by the Sea:
> Like strong winds blowing in the south,
> One invades from the wilderness,
> From a land that is feared.
###### 2
> I have received a distressing message:
> “The deceiver deceives,
> “The destroyer destroys.
> “Attack, you Elamites!
> “Lay siege, you Medes!
> “I will put an end to all the groaning.”
###### 3
> For this reason my stomach churns;
> Cramps overwhelm me
> Like the contractions of a woman in labor.
> I am disturbed by what I hear,
> Horrified by what I see.
###### 4
> My heart palpitates,
> I shake in fear;
> The twilight I desired
> Has brought me terror.
###### 5
> Arrange the table,
> Lay out the carpet,
> Eat and drink!
> Get up, you officers,
> Smear oil on the shields!
###### 6
For this is what the Lord has told me:
> “Go, post a guard!
> “He must report what he sees.
###### 7
> “When he sees chariots,
> “Teams of horses,
> “Riders on donkeys,
> “Riders on camels,
> “He must be alert,
> “Very alert.”
###### 8
> Then the guard cries out:
> “On the watchtower, O Lord,
> “I stand all day long;
> “At my post
> “I am stationed every night.
###### 9
> “Look what’s coming!
> “A charioteer,
> “A team of horses.”
> When questioned, he replies,
> “Babylon has fallen, fallen!
> “All the idols of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”
###### 10
> O my downtrodden people, crushed like stalks on the threshing floor,
> What I have heard
> From the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,
> The God of Israel,
> I have reported to you.
## Bad News for Seir
###### ¶ 11
> This is an oracle about Dumah:
> Someone calls to me from Seir,
> “Watchman, what is left of the night?
> “Watchman, what is left of the night?”
###### 12
> The watchman replies,
> “Morning is coming, but then night.
> “If you want to ask, ask;
> “Come back again.”
## The Lord Will Judge Arabia
###### ¶ 13
> This is an oracle about Arabia:
> In the thicket of Arabia you spend the night,
> You Dedanite caravans.
###### 14
> Bring out some water for the thirsty.
> You who live in the land of Tema,
> Bring some food for the fugitives.
###### 15
> For they flee from the swords—
> From the drawn sword,
> And from the battle-ready bow,
> And from the severity of the battle.
###### ¶ 16
For this is what the Lord has told me: “Within exactly one year all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end.
###### 17
“Just a handful of archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be left.” Indeed, the LORD God of Israel has spoken.
